<p><b>How he fits:</b> This appears to be a perfect fit of a quarterback's skill set with the Colts' new offensive philosophy. Offensive coordinator Bruce Arians will run a Pittsburgh-style scheme with a lot of bunch formations and movement and some no-huddle. Luck will have a lot of freedom to audible at the line of scrimmage. They want to be a much more run-oriented offense which could set up good play action, which is Luck's strength.

If Luck is 1, then RG3 is 1A. In fact, he has an even stronger arm and he moves just as well. If he stays healthy, he'll be the quarterback Washington so desperately needed and well worth the picks they gave up to get him. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> He is a perfect guy to run Mike Shanahan's offense, which is a strong zone-blocking run game and a passing game that wants the QB to roll out, throw a lot of bootlegs and motion some off play action and that leads to a lot of half-field reads and scrambles, which fits RG3 perfectly. They will also use a lot of motions and shifts and multi-receiver packages to give him a lot of options in the passing game. He will always be a threat to tuck the ball and run. They worked hard to give him a supporting cast in free agency.

There's a good reason Richardson is only the seventh RB to come off the boards in the first five picks in the past 10 years. He's a complete football player. He's a power back who can grind out yards between the tackles, and he's quick enough to get outside to where he can make defenders miss. His ability to contribute on third down makes him that much more attractive considering the direction NFL offenses are heading.

<p><b>How he fits:</b> This was a major need for the Browns. And what separates Richardson from a lot of backs is that he's a three-down player. This offense had no explosiveness or big plays from the running game a year ago and they were at the bottom of the league and yards after contact were an afterthought. That all changes with Richardson. Not only will he be effective between the tackles, but he is also an excellent receiver out of the backfield and he is a good pass-blocker and very effective in blitz pickup. With new offensive coordinator Brad Childress, it will be a West Coast-style offense. They will emphasize the run game to keep pressure off their quarterback position and, as mentioned, Richardson doesn't need to come off the field.</p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> This offensive line gave up 49 sacks in 2011 and a lot of the big hits that QB Christian Ponder absorbed were over the left side. Kalil has excellent range and he will match up on the best edge rushers in the league. He will give Ponder time to throw the ball. This will also be a run-first offense, and he should be good in the run game and on the second level.

This was the worst pass offense in the NFL a year ago. Of course, part of the problem was QB Blaine Gabbert, however, it has been the worst receiving corps in the NFL for the past few years. The Jaguars did sign free agent Laurent Robinson from Dallas and Mike Thomas has a chance to be OK, but now they have a difference-maker and a guy who can stretch the field. All of a sudden, this pathetic passing game now has a three-wide receiver set and a nickel package that can actually threaten some defenses. This has been a short, conservative passing game in the past because they had no choice. Now, they can air it out with Blackmon or they can let him take those short to intermediate passes where he can run after the catch.

They tried to address the secondary with free agent Brandon Carr from Kansas City, but that was certainly not enough. They just haven't been a group that can line up successfully in man-to-man schemes, especially versus multi-receiver sets. Under defensive coordinator Rob Ryan, they love to blitz a lot to create pressure, and that puts these corners on an island in those man coverages. Now, the Cowboys have two turn-and-run cover corners they can depend on.

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
The secondary was a tremendous area of weakness a year ago and they just gave up a lot -- they were 31st in the NFL in average gain per pass play -- and plenty of those came between the hashes. Their safeties are nondescript both versus the run and the pass. While this has been a Cover 2 zone-type secondary in the past, we will see more man-to-man looks under new coach Greg Schiano. We actually could see Barron team with Ronde Barber inside in some packages. He is a playmaker in every area. He will give this defense a lot of the big plays they've been missing the past couple of years in both man and zone.

Tannehill is one of the most talked-about prospects in this draft. On one hand, there are concerns about his lack of experience and his inability to win games late last year. On the other hand, he has all the physical tools and mental toughness teams look for in a starting quarterback.
It's also important to point out that he's more accurate than the numbers suggest, because his receivers dropped so many balls last year that it skewed his completion percentage and hindered his ability to win games. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
This is certainly a pick that seems to make a lot of sense because the Dolphins know everything about this guy with Miami offensive coordinator Mike Sherman as his former head coach at Texas A&M. Tannehill has a tremendous skill set, but there's a lot of room to develop. Under new head coach Joel Philbin, the Dolphins' offense is a version of a West Coast offense with a large variety of formations and personnel packages, much like he ran at Green Bay as offensive coordinator. This is a sophisticated offense that puts a premium on decision-making and reads, and Tannehill just needs time to recognize matchups, see blitzes and learn how to audible at the line of scrimmage. These are all things he can do, that he will likely sit for a good portion of his rookie season and will learn behind Matt Moore or David Garrard. This is not a QB to start from day one.

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
This is a combination of a team filling a need but doing it with a great football player. This is a defense that was in the bottom third of the NFL in key categories a year ago. Its best two linebackers -- OLB Thomas Davis and MLB Jon Beason -- are coming off significant injuries. If Beason is healthy, Kuechly could play outside linebacker; if not he can play inside. It not only gives three excellent players at the position if healthy, but it also gives them tremendous insurance. They will be more aggressive in their 4-3 defense this season and they will blitz more and also play some man schemes with their linebackers, all things that Kuechly can do. He is a guy who doesn't have to come off the field in some packages.

In past years, this Buffalo secondary has really played well, and in 2011, it was very inconsistent. Part of it was because of injuries and the Bills gave up big chunks of passing yards.

The key to this 3-4 defense is being very physical on the interior and that means a big, dominating nose tackle. They have lived with undersized Kelly Gregg in the past and young Jerrell Powe is unproven and Poe now, potentially, gives them the penetrating, inside run-stuffer they have been looking for. They will tinker with some 43-and-under looks and they will use some pre-snap movement for Poe to get him in some one-on-one penetrating situations. Obviously, the huge question here is which player is he: the guy we saw him at the combine or the guy who can be inconsistent on film?

Even though it initially looks like the Eagles are in pretty good shape on the inside of their defensive line, in this Wide Nine defensive scheme, where they really play their linebackers on the edge, it gives the interior of this defense a lot of space to cover. He should be an excellent inside penetrator and a lot of one-gap schemes and the Eagles love to use a deep rotation on the defensive line and come at offenses in waves. Andy Reid will never pass on a good interior player. With Cox upfront and newly acquired DeMeco Ryans at MLB coming from Houston as a free agent, the interior of this defense has dramatically been upgraded.

Coples is a tall and rangy guy who will likely fit at defensive end in the Jets' 3-4 front, and when they switch to a 4-3 or even some 46 looks, he could be inside or outside because of his versatility as one-gap penetrator.

<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
He will likely be plugged in as a pass-rushing outside linebacker in their 3-4 defense. They have looked for a long time for a guy to complement Shaun Phillips, although his production dropped off in 2011 and we don't know where Phillips' game is right now. Free agent Jarret Johnson from Baltimore was an excellent edge pickup and surprising Antwan Barnes had 11 sacks a year ago. On the surface, it looks like this position is in pretty good shape, but the Chargers can never have too many pass-rushers and in 2012, they want to be a more aggressive blitzing defense with those front guys constantly on the move. This gives them a lot of flexibility with Ingram.

If both guys play up to form in 2012, Wright could be the perfect slot receiver inside to take advantage of his quickness, and that would give the Titans a really good three-wide receiver package.

Jones fits perfectly as a right defensive end in a 4-3 look, but he could also play OLB as an edge rusher opposite Rob Ninkovich in their 3-4 look. The Pats appreciate versatility more than any other team in the NFL, and Jones gives them flexibility in interchanging their fronts.

He certainly looks like the QB of the future and that future needs to be now for a 28-year-old. He can make every throw necessary to eventually fit in this West Coast offense and he can make all the required reads. He's coming from a college system in which he ran a lot of spread formations with quick passes and easy reads. And in this West Coast look, his passes will have to become more disciplined and his reads more focused. His ability to handle the blitz must improve dramatically, but having Trent Richardson in the fold could make his job easier. As fast as you want him to get into the lineup, it is likely he will learn in the first half of the season to improve that decision-making behind Colt McCoy.

However, he does a good job tracking the ball in the air and has a knack for making the tough catches outside of his frame. 

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
He fills a significant need for an offense with a lot of complementary guys. The Jets have only one playmaker in Santonio Holmes and because of that Holmes gets a lot of attention and rolled coverages. Hill is enough of a deep threat to really open up some defenses and with the Jets' new effort to run the football, he could become an effective play-action receiver. His size should give them good third-down and red zone production. He should also be able to help move the chains.

Allen is a four-year starter who's an above-average pass blocker for an interior offensive lineman. He does a good job covering up defenders as a run blocker, as well. The only concern is he doesn't have that nasty disposition or overall power teams covet in offensive lineman. 
</p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
He was an offensive tackle in college, but will likely step inside in this offense. Although there are some interesting scenarios, the production inside for the Chiefs a year ago was inconsistent, which is a problem for an inside run game. There just aren't enough guys to develop. Interestingly, LOT Branden Albert is their best player and he could fit well inside, which could open up Allen to moving back outside where he played in college. There are some moving parts in this pick, but we know this an offense that wants to run first.

This has not been a receiving corps that the Bears can count on in the past, though they made a major upgrade by trading for Brandon Marshall. There are injury problems with Johnny Knox, no one knows whether Devin Hester be an every-down player, the other guys are developing and there's virtually no threat at tight end. Jeffery's a big guy who should be able to help them initially in sub packages, maybe out of the slot. He should improve them in third-down situations, where they really struggled in the red zone, and he should be a big target for Jay Cutler. In a new run-oriented offense, he may get some nice matchups.

The linebacker corps for the Eagles was their worst unit a year ago and it wasn't until late in the season that they finally started to jell in their Wide Nine scheme. They gave up a lot of big yards early. They have four young guys outside that have developmental qualities, but are not complete yet. The real question now: are they just backups and special teams guys? DeMeco Ryans is an excellent free-agent pickup from Houston at MLB and he will solidify the front seven. But their need is probably for an OLB that could start and make plays or an ILB who could back up Ryans. Kendricks has experience in both positions, He gives them another interesting young guy to develop. They'll eventually get this position right.

Pete Carroll made it a priority to upgrade the overall speed and explosive plays for their linebacking group, which seemed to be missing last season. Outside starters Leroy Hill and K.J.

He is another great example of a player with tremendous versatility, which Bill Belichick loves. He can play corner or safety, man-to-man or zone, and those positions are big needs for the Pats. If he plays inside, their best cover corner, Devin McCourty, can stay at corner full time. If he plays outside, McCourty can move inside full time. Remember, they got free safety Steve Gregory from San Diego, which upgrades their range. Belichick will mix and match and figure out their best skills, and Wilson should give them depth in their sub packages.

Although the Packers don't expect a lot of pass-rush production from their defensive line, this is a position they needed to upgrade. They don't make a lot of plays, although nose tackle B.J. Raji can dominate. They could lose DE Mike Neal for the first four games with a suspension. Worthy looks like he can fit in on a DE rotation and the one thing he may give them is some inside penetrating skills as a one-gap pass rusher, which could be very effective if he's lined up next to OLBs Clay Matthews or first-round pick Nick Perry.

This defense was at the bottom of the league in sacks last season. They made a major upgrade with Kamerion Wimbley from Oakland as a defensive end, and now Brown gives them speed and athleticism as an OLB. He can blitz off the edge and he can make plays in space.

The reason Still didn't come off the board in the first round is inconsistent effort. In terms of natural ability, he has everything you're looking for in a defensive tackle. 
He's quick, he's proven his ability to get off his hands, and he's strong enough to anchor against the run.

He'll play a DT in their base 4-3 defense and a DE when they throw in some 3-4 wrinkles. The Bengals like to use a deep DL rotation and they prefer to attack the QB without a lot of blitzes, although they will as necessary. The thing that makes Still unique is the fact that he has some good inside penetrating skills that can disrupt a quarterback. He's a little bit of a feast-or-famine guy; at his best his inside playmaking will upgrade this DL.

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
At first, this doesn't look like a big need for the Lions as they have an interesting group of players. However, Broyles gives them a chance to upgrade at the slot receiver position. In this offense, they run a lot of short to intermediate routes that are fairly low-risk. Broyles is a guy who knows how to get open and work zones. If he can be that slot guy, he can really open up things outside for Calvin Johnson. He gives Matthew Stafford a consistent target.

This is a good football player who really fills a need. Current OC Todd McClure is probably in his last year and while the Falcons have some serviceable guys, they don't have a guy ready to step in and take McClure's spot.

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
The Broncos have hopefully learned that as great as Peyton Manning is, he needs a quality backup. He didn't have it in Indy, but Osweiler is that guy in Denver. He's a big with a tremendous skill set and he's playing behind Manning. He can take his time to play under center and run an NFL offense as opposed to the spread packages in college. Right now, Caleb Hanie is the backup and Osweiler will be No. 3 for this year, but look for him to be developed the way Aaron Rodgers was behind Brett Favre. This is a great spot for him.

This secondary gave up a lot of big plays a year ago between the hashes and they have been looking for someone to play opposite of free safety Eric Weddle, who has good overall range. Taylor is excellent in run support, he's a good box player and will really upgrade them against the run on the back end of this defense and should be adequate in zone pass defense.

The Chargers wanted to upgrade the TE position behind Antonio Gates because of age and durability questions. While Green won't give them much help in the run game, they have guys to do that.

The challenge for the Bears is how to use him properly. FB/TE was a forgotten position under Mike Martz, but Mike Tice will bring it back. The guys they have right now are primarily blockers, which helps the run game, but Rodriguez gives them flexibility as a move guy and outlet receiver. He's also a good second-level blocker. If they're creative, they can get some quality snaps out of him and really help Jay Cutler.

This was a glaring need for the Cardinals. They have tried to solve the OT weakness for years without much success. They gave up 54 sacks a year and a lot of those came off the edge.

Percy Harvin has been their only explosive playmaker, but their ability to keep him on the field has been a problem.

We know that Houston wanted to upgrade their receiving corps and this makes two wide receivers drafted. It seems like they were looking for an outside to stretch the field and take some attention away from Andre Johnson, and that's not what they will likely get from Martin.

At first look, wide receiver doesn't look like a big need, but they did lose Robert Meachem to free agency and Drew Brees could never have too many targets in the passing game.

The reason that they traded Asante Samuel was that he could not play the inside slot corner well not could any of their other guys. Boykin fills that nickel slot role nicely.

On paper this looks like a deep group and a solid rotation. This is a defense that wants to generate most of their pass rush from their front four with no blitzes. However, Kyle Vandenbosch is 34 years old and Cliff Avril is playing under the franchise tag and if not signed under a long-term deal, could leave in a year and the depth is decent at best. Lewis could be effective as a rotation edge guys especially against the run. This defense had a nine-man DL rotation at times during the 2011 season.

The two starters in this 3-4 defense, J.J. Watt and Antonio Smith, are really productive and their two backups are good versus the run.

Obviously, Green Bay thinks they need to get more physical inside because they drafted two DTs. The question here is where Daniels fits.

He plays with excellent balance, does a great job with angles in the run game and has good lateral agility in pass protection. He can continue to get stronger in the lower half and play with more consistent pad level.

They will be a zone-blocking offensive line. They will run stretch plays, draws and misdirection, and that requires guys up front who are athletic in space. Fisher has the best feet at his position in the draft. He will step in immediately at left offensive tackle to protect new QB Alex Smith. If somehow the Chiefs can retain Branden Albert at right tackle, which is unlikely, they will have bookend offensive tackles for the next several years. To the Chiefs' credit, they have spent several draft picks in the past three years on the offensive line, so it's a position of some strength that will only get better with Fisher.",5.05,28.5,27.0,116.0,7.59,4.44

Joeckel is an excellent pass-blocker with above-average feet and balance and also has the power and nasty streak to move defenders off the ball as a run-blocker. And when you consider his SEC experience and the awareness he shows on tape, you don't question his ability to be a starter from day one. <br><b>Video analysis</b>: <a href=""http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=9212524"">Bill Polian</a> <img src=""http://assets.espn.go.com/icons/watch.png"" width=""15"" height=""8"" border=""0"" alt=""Video"" /><br>   
<b>How he fits:</b> The Jaguars have tried to fix this unit over the past couple drafts, but they aren't where they should be. They actually have more holes inside than outside, but Eugene Monroe is acceptable at left tackle, and Joeckel should step in immediately at right tackle. This is another zone-blocking offensive line, but they want a little more physicality in the run game. They must improve their edge pass protection -- they gave up an embarrassing 50 sacks in 2012. The Jaguars front office is from the Bill Polian school of draft philosophy, and that means selecting guys from big schools who have played against elite talent. That certainly describes Joeckel to a tee. This was an easy pick for Jacksonville.",5.3,28.5,27.0,106.0,7.4,4.68

He is one of the most versatile edge players in this class, with the ability to line up at various spots along the defensive front and rush off the edge or cover receivers in space. He needs to continue to add bulk and strength, but his upside as a pass-rusher and overall high ceiling make him an intriguing prospect. <br><b>Video analysis</b>: <a href=""http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=9212572"">Bill Polian</a> <img src=""http://assets.espn.go.com/icons/watch.png"" width=""15"" height=""8"" border=""0"" alt=""Video"" /><br>   
<b>How he fits:</b> The more you look at what the Dolphins are doing on defense, the more this seems like an interesting fit. As a rangy guy who can play a 4-3 DE spot as the Dolphins transition from their old 3-4 front under new coordinator Kevin Coyle, Jordan has excellent edge pass-rush skills. But he also has the athletic ability, when they go to their hybrid 3-4 look, to either rush off the edge or drop into coverage. This defense will resemble the Cincinnati attacking scheme, and Jordan ran a high volume of plays in Oregon's up-tempo defense. He can team with Cameron Wake to give the Dolphins a terrific edge-rush package.",4.54,32.5,,122.0,7.02,4.35

He has good athleticism and played quarterback, tight end and defensive end before moving to OT the past two seasons, though his limited experience and lack of elite awareness are likely what put him behind Fisher and Joeckel. However, Johnson has very good feet in pass protection and as a run-blocker, and he plays with an edge and won't back down against any defender. <br><b>Video analysis</b>: <a href=""http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=9212613"">Todd McShay</a> <img src=""http://assets.espn.go.com/icons/watch.png"" width=""15"" height=""8"" border=""0"" alt=""Video"" /><br>   
<b>How he fits:</b> In new head coach Chip Kelly's offense, you must have an offensive line that is athletic enough run a high volume of plays. Linemen must be able to block in space, get in and out of the huddle and show excellent awareness and the ability to adjust. Johnson fits this bill perfectly, both athletically and with his experience in an up-tempo offense. He gives this offensive line very interesting flexibility. If left tackle Jason Peters is healthy, Johnson can line up immediately at right tackle and move last season's starting right tackle Todd Herremans inside. That strengthens this entire unit. If Peters isn't what he once was physically, Johnson gives the Eagles insurance at left tackle.",4.72,34.0,28.0,118.0,7.31,4.52

However, on tape he shows natural instincts coupled with explosive power and excellent closing burst for a 271-pounder.

Both of Detroit's starting defensive ends from a season ago, Kyle Vanden Bosch and Cliff Avril, are gone. Ansah figures perfectly as an end rusher in the Lions' aggressive 4-3 defense, in which they like to attack without a lot of blitzes.

<B>How he fits:</b> In this traditional 3-4 defense, under coordinator Ray Horton, this fills the Browns' biggest need at outside linebacker. It also gives them a lot of flexibility. They have a productive edge-rusher at left outside linebacker in Jabaal Sheard, and they picked up productive pass-rusher Paul Kruger from Baltimore in free agency. Mingo gives them three athletic speed-rushers, and they can also show some 4-3 fronts at times -- especially in nickel and sub packages. The athleticism that this defensive front now has is going to be very tough to block in space. Horton loves to change his fronts and bring a variety of aggressive blitzes. Cleveland wants to play fast, but under control. This probably fits Mingo's skill set nicely.

They could use an upgrade at all three inside positions, and they need to acquire at least one starting offensive tackle. In a perfect world, they would move left tackle Levi Brown to right tackle. Cooper doesn't fill the OT need, but he will probably start immediately at guard and improve the interior run game. Keep in mind that as an interior offensive lineman, his biggest strength might be in pass protection.

That leaves Austin to be a versatile guy out of the slot for a pass offense that loves to attack the middle of the field. Austin can also line up outside, and he can even give them some snaps at varied alignments. He can certainly improve the Rams' return game from last season.

With a mediocre pass-rush up front, these guys really have to hold their coverages longer than you might think. Milliner can play occasional off schemes, and he will be very versatile in their sub packages. He can step right into replace Revis.

All three of Tennessee's interior starters wound up on injured reserve last season. While the Titans did a nice job in free agency of adding offensive guards Andy Levitre from Buffalo and Rob Turner from St. Louis, they would probably like to upgrade Turner at right guard. By nature, they are a physical, between-the-tackles run game, as they attack the defense. But they will occasionally run some zone looks, and Warmack has shown he can do that if asked.

The Chargers tried to address the offensive line in free agency with the addition of King Dunlap from Philadelphia at left offensive tackle, but he isn't the long-term answer. They probably went into this draft with a potential need for at least three new starters. Fluker will likely start immediately at right tackle, which suits his skill set. That could allow Jeromey Clary to either move to left tackle and compete with Dunlap or become a swing guy.

A bigger problem might have been the lack of an upfront pass rush. As a result, it puts the defensive backs on a lot of island situations. They are forced to blitz to create pressure, which means a lot of tight man-to-man coverages. The problem is that none of their guys did it very well.

Lotulelei will potentially give the ends more favorable blocking matchups. The happiest guy on the Panthers should be middle linebacker Luke Kuechly, because Lotulelei will eat up blocks and allow Kuechly to fly to the football.

They will blitz from all over the formation, and that requires safeties who can hold up on an island where they don't have to play soft zone schemes. Right now, it looks as if last year's starters need to be upgraded. Malcolm Jenkins has regressed, and age seems to be catching up with Roman Harper. Vaccaro will not only give the Saints an outstanding athlete on the back end of this defense, but he should also be a real asset in sub packages, because he's a guy who won't be exploited in coverage.",4.63,38.0,15.0,121.0,6.78,4.06

Manuel's upside could be very intriguing, although this coaching staff has been very secretive about its offensive philosophy. We will likely see creative personnel groupings, an up-tempo passing game with some read-option wrinkles and perhaps even see an old version of the K-Gun offense that the Bills ran years ago with Jim Kelly. This is a coaching staff which can afford the time to bring along Manuel, and it already has a potentially good run game to take some pressure off him.

San Francisco lost free safety Dashon Goldson in free agency, and strong safety Donte Whitner is entering the final year of his contract. The 49ers have a couple young guys they like as depth players, but they don't appear to be ready. So the coaching staff will likely expect Reid to step in and start at free safety.

In addition to his speed, he has the height, length and body control to consistently win 50-50 balls. There are concerns about his overall toughness, but he could develop into an impact player. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> When everything is right, the Titans have a decent trio of receivers with Kenny Britt, Kendall Wright and Nate Washington. But Britt is continuously in and out of trouble, and the other two haven't established themselves as difference-makers. This offense needs a big, physical receiver who can produce on third down, and Hunter fits perfectly. This is a feast-or-famine position for Tennessee. It could have a strong quartet, or it could become a mess. This passing game goes vertical more than you might think, and Hunter's deep speed could really open things up.",4.44,39.5,,136.0,,4.33

The Eagles will use Ertz as a matchup guy in motion and even flex him outside, and he will constantly be on the move.

There are concerns about his lack of elite size and speed, along with durability issues, and you have to wonder if he can shoulder a heavy workload. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> With veteran BenJarvus Green-Ellis as Cincinnati's primary ball carrier, there's not a lot of explosion or big plays in this running game, which is mostly between the tackles. The Bengals got virtually no production out of the passing game with their backs. They lost Brian Leonard in free agency, and backup Bernard Scott only signed a one-year deal. So Bernard, while not a physical grinder, can give the Bengals good production on third down in the passing game. He can also be a nice change-of-pace back from Green-Ellis.

There is a lot to like about his positioning, instincts and ball skills in underneath zone, though. As a run defender, he must improve his ability to take on and shed blocks, and become a more consistent tackler. Overall, though, his instincts set him apart because he locates the ball quickly enough to beat blockers to the point, and has more range than some faster linebackers because he gets started more quickly. <br>

In all likelihood, Te'o will be given every chance to start at left inside linebacker. But there has to be a concern about how he fits into this scheme. He certainly seems to fit better as a 4-3 middle linebacker or even a 4-3 outside linebacker, although he played in more 3-4 looks than you might think at Notre Dame -- so maybe this isn't as big of a stretch as it might appear.

This is a versatile defense that can show a variety of 3-4 and 4-3 looks, and it will likely utilize Carradine as an edge pass-rusher -- either with his hand on the ground or coming off the edge in a two-point stance, depending on the scheme.

T.J. Graham, a rookie in 2012, is scheduled to be a starter, but he isn't a proven commodity and Woods has a chance to be a quality No. 2 on the edge.

Both starting tackles, Jared Veldheer and Khalif Barnes, are decent players, but the depth behind them is virtually nonexistent. This group has really struggled with blocking schemes, as the Raiders have gone back and forth between man and zone looks. Now they've settled on a power, man-blocking look, and that might not fit Watson's skills perfectly. He's a little more of a space player -- not necessarily a road grader.

<b>How he fits:</b> This Bucs secondary has been a disaster in the past couple years -- both in terms of personnel and scheme. For as long as we can remember, the Bucs have played a Cover 2 zone concept, which required physicality, but not turn-and-run cover guys. This coaching staff is trying to play a lot more man-to-man schemes, but it just doesn't have the players to get it done. That leads to allowing a tremendous amount of big plays. Newly acquired cornerback Darrelle Revis goes a long way toward fixing this weakness, but Ronde Barber is near the end of his career and might not be back. The rest of Tampa Bay's corner options aren't very exciting. The edge of this secondary needs speed and the ability to shut down vertical plays.

If he can keep his pads low consistently, Short will help improve a run defense. He can also stay on the field in passing situations, with the foot speed, powerful hands and lower-body strength to push the pocket. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The edge of this defensive line, with Charles Johnson and Greg Hardy, is excellent. The interior has been a consistent problem. The Panthers have given up too many inside run plays, produced marginal inside pass-rush pressure and there's very little depth. With their first two picks going to big, physical defensive tackles, this line has dramatically changed. The biggest beneficiary might be the linebackers -- especially Luke Kuechly, who now has players in front of him to eat up blocks and allow him to fly to the ball.

325,30381,Kiko Alonso,ILB,238,75.375,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<b>What he brings:</b> Alonso is a high-energy player with above-average athleticism and closing burst. He has a knack for finding the ball and making big plays, and shows very good awareness in underneath zone coverage. Alonso has the potential to be an impact pass-rusher between the tackles as well. He will get caught out of position at times and could play with more discipline at times, but that can be corrected with coaching. <br>
<b>How he fits</b> The interior run defense for Buffalo was terrible last season, and the Bills were the worst in the league at allowing yards before contact. They have a couple players in Kelvin Sheppard and strongside linebacker Nigel Bradham, but neither are proven and there's no depth. Without a veteran they can count on at inside linebacker, Alonso has a chance to compete immediately as a starter in this 4-3 defense, which can change up looks to a 3-4 and even a 46. He also might be good enough in coverage to stay on the field on third down in the Bills' 4-2-5 nickel package.",4.74,,,,,

He doesn't have great speed, but he is fast enough to work the seam and pick up some yards after catch. There's a lot to like about his frame and potential as a blocker, but the problem is that it's just potential at this point. He has to improve at the point of attack.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The coaches have wanted to incorporate more two-tight end sets in recent years. But the backups to starter Jason Witten aren't really pass-catching types. Escobar is a receiving-type player who can move and flex, and he will give this pass offense much more flexibility. Look for Escobar and Witten to continue to run a lot of seam routes, and Escobar should be an excellent matchup receiver. He also provides insurance for Witten, who's still playing at a high level but is entering his 11th pro season. Tony Romo likes to use sight adjustment with his tight ends, which means Escobar needs to be a quick study in this offense to instill confidence. ",4.84,32.0,,114.0,7.07,4.31

He has great patience, vision and power between the tackles, and can run over defenders and make them miss. In the passing game, he is an above-average route runner who can line up in the slot, split wide or release out of the backfield. Bell is also an excellent overall pass blocker. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> For as long as we can remember, this offense has been identified as a physical run attack that sets up the passing game. But in the past couple years, inconsistent play and key injuries have taken away almost all of the Steelers' big-play ability. The coaches are demanding a more productive inside run game, but the players they have to get it done just aren't special. Bell will have every chance to start immediately, and he can give the Steelers not only power, but explosive plays that they've been missing in the run game. If he's productive, it takes a lot of pressure off Ben Roethlisberger and makes Pittsburgh's play-action package a legitimate weapon.",4.6,31.5,24.0,118.0,6.75,4.24

Hankins can handle blockers one-on-one and shed them in time to make the play. He won't be a productive pass-rusher in terms of sacks, but he can disrupt the pocket. The downside of his size is limited burst and a tendency to wear down at times. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> While there has been concern about the overall decline of this defensive line, it looked as if there might be more problems on the edge than inside. The Giants seem to have done a nice job in free agency by adding defensive tackles Cullen Jenkins and Mike Patterson from Philadelphia to team with the other starter, Linval Joseph. The Giants also have veteran Shaun Rogers and a young player they like, Marcus Kuhn, who was a rookie in 2012. The only significant player New York lost was Chris Canty. Hankins is also probably only a two-down player who won't likely contribute on the edge. This looks like a classic value pick, rather than a need pick.",5.31,26.0,,104.0,7.59,4.61

However, he is inconsistent at times with his run fits, and he is a little tight changing directions. Still, he has the size and top-end speed to develop into a quality starting middle linebacker in the Bears' scheme. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Obviously there's a tremendous need at middle linebacker with the departure of Brian Urlacher, although the Bears seem to have a short-term fix with the signing of veteran free agent D.J. Williams from Denver. This allows Bostic time to develop because the other backups don't seem to be impact players. The good news is the Bears will continue to be able to run their 4-3 defense, but they will play a lot more man-to-man schemes than the Cover 2 we've seen for years. This means Bostic won't have to drop into deep zones -- but it will be necessary for him to be productive in man-to-man to stay on the field on third down.",,,,,,

He took a step back in 2012, though, after leading the nation in interceptions in 2011. The biggest concerns are his inability to quickly transition out of breaks and his struggles when turning to locate the ball. However, if you play to his strengths and put him in press-man coverage, he can be an asset. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This secondary really struggled in pass defense last season, and it was really exposed by quarterbacks who attacked vertically. Washington has one player that it can count on somewhat, DeAngelo Hall, but his play is starting to slip. The other corners, Josh Wilson, Richard Crawford and E.J. Biggers, are just average players competing for the No. 2 position. This group is really exposed when it has to go to sub packages against multi-receiver sets. Defensive coordinator Jim Haslett likes to play press schemes, which fits the skill set of Amerson, but he's not a turn-and-run vertical cover player.",4.44,35.5,15.0,127.0,,

His value is that he can get after the quarterback. He ran a 4.64 at the combine and that speed shows up on tape. He can get around the corner and closes very well. There is also a lot to like about his tackling, doing a nice job wrapping in space and delivering big hits on quarterbacks. You would like to see more consistent effort at times, though. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a bit of a curious pick because linebacker didn't appear to be a need for this defense. New England's starting linebackers are a strength of the team. The Patriots get a lot of production from outside linebackers Jerod Mayo and Dont'a Hightower, so this looks like a classic value pick. One thing that may work in Collins' favor is his versatility. He should be able to play outside linebacker in their 3-4 look and defensive end when they go to 4-3, or he could even play up in that scheme. We know the Patriots really like to change things up to keep offenses off balance. In Collins, they get a player who can add depth and versatility, and he might really be able to help the Pats in their edge pass rush.",4.64,41.5,19.0,139.0,7.1,4.32

The level of competition he faced late in 2012 is questionable, but it's tough to deny the strides he made, especially as a pass-rusher. He is strong enough to get off blocks and fast enough to chase backs down from behind. And with his length, leaping ability and timing makes him a terror both in terms of affecting passing lanes and blocking kicks. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Bengals love to have a deep rotation in their defensive line. That unit was terrific last season, and everybody is back. This didn't appear to be a critical need, but Hunt is an interesting pick. He's somewhat of a raw player with limited experience who will have time to develop behind solid veterans. Hunt also has some versatility as a player who fits best as a 4-3 edge rusher, but he could even move down inside in nickel situations as a one-gap penetrator. While he's learning the nuances of the defensive end position, he could make an immediate contribution on special teams as a kick blocker.

He has great eyes in coverage and does a great job maintaining strong position. In addition, he flashes an extra gear to recover and the ability to locate and play the ball. Taylor is willing to step up in run support, but could become more physical and efficient in that area. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This wasn't a great perimeter cover group in 2012, partly because of injuries and partly because of inconsistent play. Miami's best corner, Sean Smith, is gone, along with Bryan McCann. The Dolphins did add a premier free agent in Brent Grimes from Atlanta, but this secondary only produced 10 interceptions last season. Big plays and creating turnovers wasn't a strength. The Dolphins love to play aggressive man-to-man schemes, which seem to fit Taylor's skill set, and he will likely will be given a great chance to start at left corner, while other players can compete for the slot corner position. This pass defense really needs Taylor to be productive quickly.",4.39,35.0,22.0,127.0,6.82,4.06

There are concerns about his hands after an underwhelming Senior Bowl week, but he's not afraid to work the middle and can make tough catches. He just needs to become more consistent in that area. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> We knew the 49ers would address this position early in the draft with the loss in free agency of Delanie Walker to Tennessee. More than any other offense in the NFL, they love multi-tight end packages and the ability to be exotic in personnel groupings. While McDonald doesn't have the athleticism and big-play capability of Vernon Davis, he can certainly help as either an in-line or motion player. He can also be a good contributor in the short-to-intermediate passing game. What may be a sneaky strength of this pick is that it will allow the 49ers to use multiple tight ends to force defenses to play sub packages -- then they can come back and run the ball.

He is light on his feet and holds up well in space, particularly in coverage. He lacks ideal take-on skills, but does a good job wading through traffic and absorbing blocks to disengage and find his gap. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Brown has experience both inside and outside on the college level, but in this Ravens 3-4 defense, he will line up inside and hopefully give them Dannell Ellerbe-type production. The Ravens lost both inside linebackers from last season, Ellerbe and Ray Lewis. Also, with Jameel McClain trying to come back from injury, and the strong possibility that Rolando McClain might not be a part of the team's future, this was a glaring need. Brown will likely be forced to start on opening day, but he has a chance to stay on the field on third down because of good athletic ability, range and cover skills, especially when the Ravens play their ""dollar"" defense which features two defensive linemen, three linebackers and six defensive backs.",4.62,,,116.0,,

He understands positioning and leverage, and takes great angles to the point in coverage. He also plays with an aggressive, physical demeanor in run support, and shows the ability to deliver big hits and jar the ball loose. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The bad news for the Texans is that they lost their best safety, Glover Quin, in free agency. But the good news is they replaced him with future Hall of Fame free safety Ed Reed. However, this secondary gave up too many big inside passing plays a year ago, and it was vulnerable between the hashes. Strong safety Danieal Manning is an up-and-down player who gives up some big plays, so Swearinger has a great chance to compete for the starting strongside job. His skill set fits the position perfectly and should complement what Reed does. If he doesn't unseat Manning immediately, he can give Houston a quality No. 3 option while learning. We don't know how much longer Reed can play, so Swearinger fits a real need.",4.67,37.0,17.0,124.0,6.7,4.11

Ball's top-end speed isn't elite, but he is quick enough to get around the corner and can make the first defender miss. He is also an underrated receiver who didn't get much chance in that area. He can catch the ball well and transition upfield quickly. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> In the past couple years, this usually dependable Broncos run game hasn't been very productive. Because of inconsistent personnel and injuries, Peyton Manning was forced to run an almost one-dimensional pass offense. Veterans Willis McGahee and Knowshon Moreno are solid when healthy, but durability and age are question marks. Backup Ronnie Hillman doesn't have enough size to be an every-down back. Denver has really needed a back it can count on. Ball has a chance to be a physical, between-the tackles runner with a heavy workload, and that can lead to offensive balance, a much more effective play-action package and the ability to close out a game. This pick should please Manning.",4.66,32.0,15.0,118.0,6.88,4.4

His release off the line stands out, and he hits his stride quickly. He also tracks the ball well and can make athletic catches down the field. Dobson's frame and ability to separate underneath make him an ideal candidate to be a No. 2 receiver at the next level. He is also competitive as a blocker, over the middle and after the catch. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> For the past couple years, the Patriots have had multiple weapons in the short-to-intermediate passing game. But they've been one of the worst offenses in the NFL at stretching the perimeter because they haven't had a deep threat since Randy Moss. New England failed to land Emmanuel Sanders from Pittsburgh as a restricted free agent, so Dobson will be expected to step in and start on the edge. If he can stretch the field like the Pats think he can, it will open up a lot of options underneath. With so many different personnel groupings and sight adjustment as the play develops, Dobson should have success early because he's an instinctive player who has a chance to earn Tom Brady's confidence early in this thinking man's passing game.",4.37,,,,,

He transitions well out of breaks and shows good closing burst, but he lacks ideal instincts and is a better athlete than football player at this point. In particular, he struggles in run support and must learn to take better angles in that area. Still, he is the kind of player who can contribute in sub packages and make an immediate impact as a returner. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Corner was an obvious need for this secondary heading into this draft, as the Falcons lost starters Brent Grimes and Dunta Robinson in free agency. The remaining corners, including Asante Samuel, are probably more short-term fixes than long-term solutions. This secondary plays a lot of sub packages -- in fact they play nickel half the time -- which requires a corner depth. Either first-round pick Desmond Trufant or Alford should be able to start immediately, with the other producing in the sub package while waiting to be a starter.

He is a tough, powerful runner, though, who can get yards after contact and punish defenders in space. And while he doesn't look like a blazer on tape, his speed doesn't raise a red flag. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> It seems as if running back is at the top of Green Bay's need list every year, and this draft is no exception. The Packers have tried to manufacture a running game with inferior personnel. They have no offensive balance, and they give Aaron Rodgers very little help. Part of the problem is an offensive line that doesn't run-block very well. Because opposing defenses don't respect the threat of the run game, they can sit back in deep coverages and take away Rodgers' vertical passing game. If Lacy can stay healthy, he can change that. He can be a physical, between-the-tackles runner, eat up the clock -- especially in bad weather -- and can give Rodgers a play-action package he hasn't had in a while.",4.55,,,,,

However, a laundry list of injuries and character concerns caused him to drop into the late second round. If Seattle can keep him focused, Michael has a chance to be a steal at this point. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This certainly didn't look like a need, as the Seahawks already have a terrific backfield trio of fullback Michael Robinson and tailbacks Marshawn Lynch and Robert Turbin. So this is a case of simply taking someone off the board whom they had rated highly. If Michael can stay healthy, he can add to a back rotation which Seattle used a lot more than you might think a year ago. The Seahawks could have three tailbacks -- with a lead fullback -- that can wear down defenses and totally control the game.

<b>How he fits:</b> This looks like another value pick, rather than a need, as the Chiefs already have Tony Moeaki and incoming free agent Anthony Fasano. When you look at this offense, the Chiefs probably have a low-level need for a No. 3 tight end who can give them production in the passing game. Kelce will likely be a move player who will flex and line up wide to get good matchups. It looks as if new coach Andy Reid wants to use more multi-tight-end sets than he did in Philadelphia, and the addition of Kelce gives them a lot of flexibility in the short passing game.",4.63,,,,,

<b>How he fits:</b> The Jaguars' top four defensive backs from a year ago are all gone, although they have added cornerback Alan Bell from Houston as an unrestricted free agent. The combination of an inconsistent pass rush and lack of turn-and-run corners spells trouble.

He is a playmaker who can hold up in man or zone coverage. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Outside linebacker hasn't been perceived as a critical need, but this is another value pick. Moore fits perfectly in the 4-3.

The Cardinals have one elite, shutdown corner in Patrick Peterson, who can take the other team's best receiver out of the game.

Those three are outside cover players, which should allow Mathieu to play over the slot and contribute in sub packages. In addition, he should be outstanding on special teams, both in coverage and as an electrifying returner. Can you imagine having Mathieu and Peterson as your returners?

Freeman continues to have inconsistent streaks and make bad decisions, and Glennon has a good enough skill set to potentially develop into a good player.

He is a long strider who tracks the deep ball well, and is also athletic enough to come down with jump balls. <br>

Allen also shows above-average body control and strong hands, and is underrated after the catch. Throw in his intelligence and toughness to work the middle of the field, as well as line up outside the hashes, and Allen brings great value at this point. <br>
<b>How he fits</b> The Chargers love young Danario Alexander, veteran Malcom Floyd is a solid contributor, and Vincent Brown should come back solid from injury. However, the veteran free-agent duo of Eddie Royal and Robert Meachem from a year ago never really panned out. That opens the way for Allen as a sound edge receiver who can help in sub packages and give San Diego depth.

It's also somewhat surprising that he doesn't play the ball better considering his experience on offense, though that could improve as he gets better at reading quarterbacks and receivers. However, he has the blend of size, speed and fluidity to play safety at the NFL level if he continues to improve.  Even though he isn't a fundamentally sound tackler, he's not afraid to step up and he flashes some pop.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The safety position gave up a ton of big plays a year ago, and they were horrible against tight ends -- especially down the seams. The Cowboys added Will Allen in free agency, but they are also making a philosophical switch from man-to-man schemes to Cover 2 on the back end.

His stock has steadily dropped because of a poor workout, concerns about his work ethic and inconsistency setting the edge against the run. His timed top-end speed is somewhat misleading. He plays much faster and he's shown that he can get after the quarterback on tape. He is quick off the ball when he times the snap well and he flashes the ability to translate to speed to power. While there are concerns about his effort against the run, he is relentless chasing the quarterback.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This has been one of the deepest units in the NFL in recent years -- especially at defensive end. The Giants aren't getting quite the same production as they have in the past, although they do get a boost by the projected move of Mathias Kiwanuka back to defensive end from outside linebacker. That gives them Justin Tuck and Jason Pierre-Paul as the starters and Adewale Ojomo as a young developmental player.

He is virtually impossible to move off the ball with one man, and he can hold his ground when he keeps his pads down. There's also a lot to like his athletic ability and effort for his size. The downside is that he doesn't offer much as a pass rusher and chances are he's a career two-down player.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> As the Saints make the transition from a 4-3 to a 3-4 defense under Rob Ryan, they're going to need more physical players on the defensive line. Right now, they don?t have them. Jenkins is a massive player who can eat up a lot of space and could fill in nicely at nose tackle, as most of the other inside players on this line are better suited as ends than tackles.",5.21,,30.0,,,

However, he is an instinctive player with above-average eyes and discipline in coverage. Ryan also has underrated ball skills and does a great job of maintaining position when playing the ball.  He also is one of the most effective tacklers in run support in this year's cornerback class. Throw in his big-time contributions on special teams as a non-returner and Ryan brings solid value at this point. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Re-signing Aqib Talib was a huge positive for this secondary, although they caught a break when Alfonso Dennard resolved his legal issues. Kyle Arrington is best as the No. 3 inside guy in their nickel package, and Ras-I Dowling can't stay healthy. The Pats love to play a lot of sub packages with three corners and two safeties, and that gives Ryan -- who?s a very instinctive and reliable player -- a chance to contribute in many ways.",4.56,32.5,14.0,116.0,6.69,4.06

His greatest strength is defending the run. He's aggressive, he takes sound angles for the most part, and he wraps up well. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> For years, this defense has been able to mask deficiencies on the back end because of a solid pass rush up front. But last season that wasn't the case. The safeties were exposed in man-to-man cover packages, and the Bengals just don't have anybody who can be a difference-maker or give them needed production. Williams has excellent athletic ability and a skill set in coverage, and he's physical against the run.

However, he has a natural feel as a route-runner and pass catcher to move around formations to create mismatches. Reed doesn't have elite speed, but he sets up his breaks well and shows above-average body control and hands catching the ball. In addition, he is shifty after the catch and shows good vision in the open field to pick up yards. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Although starter Fred Davis was coming off an Achilles injury, the Redskins made a good move re-signing him. Davis is a productive player in the passing game. However, his backup, Logan Paulsen, is more of a blocking tight end and doesn't give them much as a receiver in two-tight-end sets. Reed is strictly a move-type tight end who can flex in motion, which can open up this offense nicely when the Redskins want to play with two tight ends.",4.72,,16.0,,,

His natural ability isn't an issue. He shows above-average quickness and balance for a 320-pound interior offensive linemen, and he's even shown the ability to line up at tackle. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This offensive line wasn't consistent last season, especially in pass protection. That's not good when you have a franchise quarterback. The Colts are making the transition to a bigger, more physical line, and they tried to address some of their weaknesses in free agency. Thornton is the physical kind of guy they want as an inside mauler, and he has played both guard and tackle, which provides versatility.

However, he provides quickness to be disruptive as a one-gap defender and brings upside as a pass rusher in heavy passing situations as a reserve player. <br>

But after that, there's not a lot at the position. They also signed free agent Tony McDaniel from Miami. Hill gives the Seahawks a bit of a unique skill set, with penetrating athleticism and good movement skills.

<b>How he fits:</b> In the 49ers' base 3-4 scheme he probably fits best as an OLB rush guy, in an Aldon Smth-type role.

Williams lacks ideal lateral agility in pass pro, though, and can struggle when having to recover against quicker and more explosive rushers.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> As good as this offensive line has been, they have struggled on the right side, using a four-man rotation at times at guard and tackle. And they seem to like the potential of youngsters Brandon Brooks and Ben Jones, but in an offense that has a powerful right-handed run game with zone-blocking principles, they need productive guys and Williams will have a chance to compete at the ROT spot if he can zone block.

<b>How he fits:</b> The Patriots continue to rebuild their receiving corps with their second WR in the draft. They are really trying to add more speed and vertical explosiveness outside, and that's what Boyce should give them. They really haven't had that outside threat since Randy Moss. The Pats have loads of options in the short-to-intermediate passing game, but they need a guy to stretch the defense. They hope that's what Boyce can do.",4.38,34.0,22.0,131.0,6.68,4.1

Sam Acho is one quality starter and free-agent pickup Lorenzo Alexander is the other projected starter. But Okafor has a chance to compete with Alexander and at the very least add OLB depth. The Cardinals really need him to set the edge versus the outside run, which was a problem a year ago.",4.78,,21.0,,,

In addition, Jenkins has had trouble staying healthy, and those durability concerns likely pushed him into the third round. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Dolphins have made a nice transition from a 3-4 scheme to a 4-3, and they really want versatility to play a lot of sub packages. They are decent right now with their OLB starters, but their depth isn't good enough.

The only returning guy is C Fernando Velasco, whom the coaches really seem to like. He can also play guard.

<b>How he fits:</b> This is obviously a value pick for the Giants as they looked at who was left on their board. They have one solid backup behind Eli Manning in veteran David Carr. Nassib has a chance to really develop into a very solid QB, and because Manning is not really close to the end of his career, this coaching staff could either develop Nassib as a potential trade asset, or let him move into the No. 2 spot as a long-term backup.",5.06,28.5,,105.0,7.34,4.53

He was hampered by a coaching change as a senior, and did not show as much consistency after Bobby Petrino left. His decision-making took a step back in 2012 as well.

They did bring in Osi Umenyiora from the Giants, and he has the skill set the team needs. But the other projected starter, Kroy Biermann, is not an elite rusher, and they would like to move him around the formation. There is not much depth here, and Goodman appears to be the perfect guy to bring along, but he may be forced to be the No. 3 DE at first. ",4.87,31.5,26.0,114.0,,

He shows quick feet to gain a clean release, and while he lacks elite top-end speed and burst out of cuts, he does a nice job of working defenders in his stem to gain separation. Patton flashes ability to come down with the tough catch outside of his frame, but he needs to get stronger and show better focus at times both in traffic and battling for contested throws. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Patton looks like a depth selection for a unit that already has several quality players. The 49ers have five productive players with varied skill sets who are all ahead of Patton, and it looks like it will be tough for Patton to get quality snaps. However, we know that this staff likes to roll out a lot of exotic personnel groupings, so if Patton can find a certain niche, it would give him a chance to be a contributor.",4.53,33.0,8.0,118.0,6.91,4.01

<b>How he fits:</b> Although he's listed as a DE, his best fit on this 3-4 defense is as an OLB edge rusher. He is relentless and adds to a group that already has solid depth and a variety of skill sets.

He can hold up in pass pro or release when he lines up in the backfield, and he can line up in the slot.   <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Although this looks like a peculiar selection because the Ravens already have Vontae Leach at FB, Juszczyk has a skill set with a little more versatility. He could potentially contribute in an H-back-type role and adds some versatility to the Ravens' passing game, which already has an intriguing two-TE set.

In addition, he is a patient runner who utilizes his blocks well. Throw in his versatility and natural pass-catching ability, and he is a three-down back if able to fully recover from the latest injury. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> At first glance, this doesn't appear to be any kind of need for the 49ers, but Frank Gore is starting to age, Kendall Hunter is coming off an injury and LaMichael James was a non-factor last season.

At 6-foot-7, he plays a little high and can give ground as a run defender, though he is tougher than strong at the point. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Lions' DE corps has undergone a makeover this offseason. Kyle Vanden Bosch, Cliff Avril and Lawrence Jackson have departed, but the team picked up Jason Jones from Seattle and returns Ronnell Lewis and Willie Young. Now the Lions have Taylor as a developmental edge guy to complement first-round pick Ziggy Ansah.

He's also an above-average inline blocker who gets into position and walls off defenders.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Falcons need a guy in place to step in for Tony Gonzalez after the 2013 season. The guys they have on the roster are complementary players and not very productive in the passing game for a Matt Ryan-led offense that loves to throw to the tight end. You would think the Falcons would look for an athletic, move guy who can flex and motion, but Toilolo is more of an inline guy with great size. He should have great production in the red zone, catching the high ball similar to Gonzalez.

562,33597,Jadeveon Clowney,DE,266,77.25,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<b>What he brings:</b> Clowney possesses ideal size, length and athleticism. He has an explosive first step and quick hands, and he uses his length well off the edge. Although his production dropped last season, he was still having a big impact throughout our tape study.  Clowney has to learn to play with a more consistent effort and must develop some technique. However, he is a rare talent and has one of the highest ceilings we've evaluated on tape. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> He has the best skill set in the draft. But will he play that way each week? This is a 3-4 Romeo Crennel defense with a lot of two-gap looks and less penetrating than a one-gap Wade Phillips scheme. That is not Clowney's forte. However, he will play outside linebacker in the base package, and we will see a lot more four-man fronts and sub packages. The Texans will get their best from pass-rushers on the field in passing situations. He has lined up all over the defensive line (&agrave; la J.J. Watt) and he could even line up next to Watt at left outside linebacker -- wow! Crennel will adjust and make this work.  ",4.53,37.5,21.0,124.0,7.27,4.43
563,34748,Greg Robinson,OT,332,77.0,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<b>What he brings:</b> Robinson is a rare talent who excels at moving defenders off the ball in the run game. His initial pop and finishing strength at the line of scrimmage, in addition to his ability to get to the second level and envelop linebackers in space, are outstanding. Although his hand placement is inconsistent and he holds too much at this point, he can get better in this area and is almost impossible to beat when he gets his hands inside and locks on. Auburn's run-heavy scheme raises some concern when it comes to his ability to pick up assignments and his technique in pass protection, but he has the length (35-inch arms), quickness and foot speed to protect the edge working against the league's best edge-rushers when he's fundamentally sound.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a nice marriage between drafting the best player on the board who also fills a big need. He is an excellent athlete and natural left tackle who will upgrade an offensive line that has not been consistent in pass protection in front of a quarterback who is not overly mobile. This offense will show a lot of no-huddle with three- and five-step drops, and it is mostly a man-blocking offensive line, which suits Robinson perfectly. With left tackle Jake Long coming off a knee injury, Robinson is insurance. With right tackle Joe Barksdale playing better than expected, look for Robinson to line up at left guard to give the Rams an elite left side. He could easily move to left or right tackle if necessary.",4.92,28.5,32.0,113.0,7.8,4.86

He has prototypical size, mobility and outstanding intangibles. He is not a finished product and needs some work with his lower-body mechanics to improve velocity and accuracy. However, he shows excellent poise inside the pocket and has great instincts when extending plays and working off schedule. Bortles' game reminds us a lot of a young Ben Roethlisberger.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a team with multiple needs, but it has no chance unless it has a quarterback to build around. Bortles will be that guy. Without a legitimate run game and a so-so offensive line, he will be under a lot of pressure. With marginal pass protection and poor blitz pickup, we will see a lot of slants and quick crossing routes with safe passes designed for yards after catch. Bortles will use screen and draw plays and would excel in play-action if the Jaguars can develop a decent run game. This offense likes to attack the middle of the defense, and the coaches are looking for more creativity in the play calling. Bortles is smart and competitive and has some Big Ben similarities.

565,33609,Sammy Watkins,WR,211,72.75,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<b>What he brings:</b> Watkins is an explosive and dynamic weapon who can climb over the top of the coverage, go the distance after the catch and make plays in the return game. There's room for improvement when it comes to his route-running, but he's capable of separating from man coverage, as he drops his weight well and accelerates out of his cuts. There's the occasional focus drop, and he can improve his ability to hold on to the ball when the defender times the hit well, but he has the body control, leaping ability and frame to make highlight-reel catches. It's a deep and talented receiver class; it says a lot that he sits atop it.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was the 28th-ranked pass offense a year ago, and veteran receiver Stevie Johnson is the only player the Bills were able to count on. Watkins gives the Bills the big-play capability they have been missing and a vertical presence. We will see creative personnel groupings with a high volume of no-huddle and shotgun plays. They likely will move Watkins all over the formation, with a lot of crossing routes and even some bubble screens designed for yards after the catch. With quarterback EJ Manuel still a bit of an unknown because of injury, these guys should grow together, and their ability to let the coaches install the total playbook will be important.

566,34108,Khalil Mack,OLB,251,74.625,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<b>What he brings:</b> An excellent run-stopper, Mack has the violent hands to get off blocks, range to make plays in pursuit and outstanding striking power as a tackler. He's just as effective on third down. He's an effective speed-to-power pass-rusher with the upper-body strength to press offensive tackles, drive them back and get off the block in time to make the play. Mack also shows good range in underneath zone, and he's capable of running with tight ends in coverage. The biggest knock is the level of competition he faced playing in the Mid-American Conference. Although he shined against Ohio State, critics are quick to point out he didn't face elite offensive tackles in that game, either. Fair points, but Mack didn't make Buffalo's schedule, and he checks all the boxes when it comes to the physical attributes.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a 4-3 defense with some unique fronts, and the Raiders can easily go to a 3-4 look, as they are constantly trying to confuse offenses. They have a defense with too many aging players who are not game-changers; Mack could alter that. Their linebackers made a lot of tackles last season, but too many were at the second level. Mack is excellent versus the run, at the point of attack and on a defense that is forced to blitz a lot to create pressure. He can play outside linebacker in a 3-4 look and can be productive as a defensive end when they go to a sub-package from a man front.

However, he has tremendous experience, technique, awareness and versatility. Matthews does a nice job of sustaining as a run-blocker and shows polished feet in pass protection. He comes from great bloodlines and is one of the most NFL-ready prospects in this entire class.   <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> He is versatile offensive lineman with four years of experience, and we know about his great family bloodlines. He is a complete player, and the Falcons can play him at a left tackle and move starter Sam Baker to right tackle. Or they can simply play Matthews at right tackle, as he has played both positions. Matt Ryan was sacked 44 times in 2013, and this is a pass-heavy offense that requires good pass protection up front. The Falcons are making the transition from a man-blocking to zone-blocking scheme. They want their offensive line to block in space and be effective in the screen game, and Matthews can do that. But as a unit, they are not great athletes, so we might see more man blocking than we anticipated. With a tough, new offensive line coach, Mike Tice, Matthews will give them some physicality that has been missing.

However, there isn't a bigger downfield one-on-one matchup problem who has the body control and hands and utilizes his size better than Evans in this receiver class. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> He will team with Vincent Jackson to give new quarterback Josh McCown elite receivers much like he had in Chicago with Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall -- big targets who will win jump balls. New coordinator Jeff Tedford is very creative, and we will see a sophisticated scheme with spread sets and a lot of sight adjustments by the quarterback and wide receivers. Evans will work in the middle of the field, and he has a knack for adjusting his routes when his quarterback is in trouble. He might be asked to line up all over the formation in this offense, something he has not done in the past. But he will bring a needed toughness to this passing game. This is a division that doesn't have a lot of elite corners, so he should be able to produce immediately. ",4.53,37.0,12.0,,7.08,4.26

However, Gilbert comes with some boom/bust factor, as he displays some tightness, allows too much separation and can be disinterested in run support at times.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Joe Haden is an elite corner, but he gets little help from the rest of this group. Gilbert gives Cleveland two solid corners, and coach Mike Pettine can now blitz more to create more pressure, as both of these guys can play on an island and play the press technique.  This is a smart defense that asks its players to play a variety of roles, and we will even see a 4-2-5 scheme as its base package at times. Gilbert needs to improve versus the run, but his biggest contribution to this unit will be in coverage.

Barr started his career on the offensive side of the ball at UCLA and has just two years of experience on the defensive side of the ball, so he is still developing in terms of instincts. He is one of the higher risk/reward-type players in the class.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a need pick on a defense that really gets little production from its linebackers. The Vikings need to figure out how to manufacture a better pass rush to protect a pass defense that was 31st in coverage a year ago. He can play strongside or weakside linebacker in this 4-3 scheme, and although his physicality is in question, he should be a solid space player in this defense.

He dropped too many passes last year, and his effort is inconsistent, yet he's a good value pick at this point in the first round, and the reason is he's a dangerous receiver. He has the speed to stretch the field and body control to make plays downfield, plus the burst and wiggle to produce after the catch. He's also a nightmare matchup for defensive coordinators.  If you try to match up with a linebacker, he can separate underneath or get behind the coverage. If you try to match up with a safety, he does a nice job of getting inside leverage and using his frame to box out.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was not a real need, with Brandon Pettigrew and Joseph Fauria already on the roster, but the Lions love pass-catching tight ends. Offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi comes from New Orleans and knows how to get big production out of the position. We will see multiple packages with motion, flexes, seven-step drops and go-routes between the hashes. Ebron must be able to flourish in their sight-adjustment package and be on the same page with quarterback Matthew Stafford.

He uses his quickness to take away the edge, he does an excellent job of mirroring when his assignment works back inside and he's strong enough to anchor against power. Though he doesn't have an elite power base and fails to generate push at times as a run blocker, he gets into position, walls off his assignments and blocks through the whistle. He's also a smart player who shows excellent awareness both in pass protection and in the run game. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This looks a lot like value pick because it doesn't seem like a great need with left tackle Michael Roos and right tackle Michael Oher on board. This is a versatile offense that will ask the line to play man and zone, and it must be better in pass protection. But the Titans will shorten the passing game to get the ball out more quickly to help the guys up front. Lewan can play in both blocking schemes and is excellent in space, which will helps versus speed-rushers. Even though both starting tackles appear to be set, Roos is near the end of his career and Oher does not play with consistency, so there is room for Lewan to step in and compete. He will at least give them three good offensive tackles. and they want more toughness out of this unit. ",4.87,30.5,29.0,117.0,7.39,4.49

<b>How he fits:</b> This is a need pick, and it gives Eli Manning and Victor Cruz a new toy to play with. The Giants' receiving corps must be better at sight adjust and must cut down on drops (which can be a small concern for Beckham). He has been in a pro-style college pass offense, and his speed should add up to new vertical routes and open things up for Cruz on crossing routes underneath. Beckham should also be terrific after the catch. New coordinator Ben McAdoo will take more deep shots than you might think, and that is where Beckham will excel.

He's a disruptive run defender with rare initial quickness who is at his best shooting gaps and planting ball carriers in the backfield, but he also has long arms (32 5/8 inches) for his frame and the upper-body strength to press blockers off him. His ability to penetrate also makes it tough for quarterbacks to step up in the pocket, and he doesn't have to win with quickness to be an effective pass-rusher, either. He has the violent hands and motor to get to the quarterback when he doesn't win with his first move. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was a value pick because the Rams' defensive line is already terrific and this does not look like a real need. They have two elite defensive tackles in Michael Brockers and Kendall Langford, who are part of a defense that recorded 53 sacks a year ago. New coordinator Gregg Williams loves to attack with loops and stunts, and he really values quickness and penetration -- and that is the name of Donald's game.

<b>How he fits:</b> The good news is that both starting corners, Tim Jennings and Charles Tillman, are back. Both guys are in their 30s, and while they are still good players, this defense needs an infusion of youth and athletic ability. The Bears want to get away from playing as many zone coverages as they have in the past, and Fuller gives them a chance to play more man looks. They have terrible safety play, and that could mean more sub packages with multiple corners, and he gives them that flexibility.

Shazier must continue to get stronger at the point of attack, but he is an excellent space player with offenses trending to spread the field more these days. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> He has played both inside and outside in college, but in this 3-4 defense, he will likely line up at inside linebacker next to Lawrence Timmons and replace Vince Williams. Shazier is a guy who is versatile enough to stay on the field every down and can cover in man and zone looks. This is a defense with a lot of age, and his athletic ability will be appreciated.

While length is a concern, he has the quickness, foot speed and balance to protect the edge, much like former Syracuse offensive lineman Justin Pugh (32-inch arms), whom the Giants took with the 19th overall pick last year. (Pugh won the starting right tackle job.) If Martin is moved inside, he should be a day-one starter there. As far as his run-blocking is concerned, he fires off the ball, generates good initial push and sustains once locked on. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This had to be a value pick, because Dallas' defense has tremendous needs on all three levels, although the offensive line can always use an upgrade -- especially at both guard spots. Offensive line coach Bill Callahan loves to develop players, and this guy is an experienced player who could line up at all five spots. The Cowboys' O-line is a man-blocking unit that wants to be more physical inside to help out the run game, and Martin gives it that.

If he can stay healthy, Mosley should bring return here. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> We finally have the heir apparent to inside linebacker Ray Lewis, and general manager Ozzie Newsome is an Alabama guy who knows Mosley well. Mosley will start inside in the Ravens' 3-4 defense but does have some experience at weak-side outside linebacker. The Ravens will change up their looks -- 4-3, 4-6 dollar (two DLs, three LBs, six DBs) -- and Mosley can do it all.

<b>How he fits:</b> We know Rex Ryan is a defensive-oriented coach who loves to draft defensive backs, and this is a real need for a defense that is excellent up front but struggles in the back end. The Jets want to create more turnovers and big plays. They want to play a lot of tight man schemes, but that does not always suit their current personnel and can limit their willingness to blitz. Pryor is very physical and should eliminate some of the big plays they gave up in the passing game a year ago.

He also has the length (35 inches) and athletic ability to hold up on an island in pass pro when he sinks his hips and keeps moving his feet. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> James might be a little bit of a reach in the first round, but Miami's offensive line was terrible in 2013, and the team had no choice but to go in this direction after giving up 58 sacks a year ago. We will see more zone-blocking concepts with stretch plays, misdirection with draw plays and screens. These are all things that James can do well.

Cook compares to Ravens WR Steve Smith with the ability to play in the slot as well as outside the hashes, as he plays bigger than his measureables indicate. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> It is never a shock to see the Saints upgrade in the passing game, but they do have needs at wide receiver. Marques Colston is starting to age, and Kenny Stills is the other starter at WR. Depth is not there for an offense that uses a lot of spread/multi-wide receiver sets. Cooks gives them a guy who can stretch the field with big vertical plays and yards after the catch. He could also be very effective on bubble screens.

While he's not the most physical run-stuffer in this safety class, he takes sound pursuit angles, he can get off blocks and he's an above-average open-field tackler. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Packers did not get a single interception from the safety position a year ago and they lack playmakers and depth inside on the back end of this defense. Clinton-Dix is the ultimate center fielder and a guy who can run this secondary. They don't get great pass-rush pressure, and that exposes their defensive backs in coverage and forces them to play sub packages 60 percent of the time to match up versus spread offenses. They seem to have a lot of busted coverages and miscommunication that lead to big plays, but those are things Clinton-Dix should help fix.

On the downside, there are concerns about his ability to make plays from within the pocket and stay healthy in the NFL. Plus, his off-the-field behavior has some wondering if he'll be the kind of leader who's the first player in and the last player out of the building. On the plus side, he's a fierce competitor when he takes the field, he has above-average arm strength and he is an escape artist who can buy time for his receivers to get open and break long runs when he gets a lane to scramble.<br>

Offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan knows how to coach a mobile quarterback because he did so with RG III in Washington, and Manziel has similar qualities.

His slight frame isn't as much of a concern as it is for other corners with similar size, though.  He's a tough run-stopper who tackles well, and he's an aggressive cover corner who's willing to mix it up with much bigger receivers. More importantly, he has excellent man-to-man cover skills and he does a nice job of playing the ball.  <br>

Benjamin must develop as a route runner and displays some inconsistencies catching the football. He is by far one of the bigger boom/bust prospects in this draft. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was a glaring need for an offense that is devoid of playmakers in the passing game. Benjamin is a giant wide receiver who will attack the seams -- something the Panthers have not had -- but he's inconsistent. Carolina's passing game is fairly simple without a lot of sight adjustments, and that allows the receivers to run fairly simple routes. Benjamin should be a good jump-ball target and red zone option for QB Cam Newton.

<b>How he fits:</b> After losing Donte Whitner to free agency, San Francisco has bolstered the depth at safety with the signing of Antoine Bethea from Indianapolis and taking Ward in the first round. With Bethea filling the strong safety role and 2013 first-round pick Eric Reid at free safety, Ward's versatility and ability to hold up in man coverage and defending the run will be appealing as a slot defender in defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's heavy Cover 2 scheme.

He's a quick-twitched athlete with an above-average combination of suddenness, fluidity and straight-line speed. He has massive hands (10 1/4 inches) and the leaping ability and body control to play the ball, as well. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Denver signed Aqib Talib away from New England, but Champ Bailey and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie have both signed elsewhere. Tony Carter is more of sub-package corner who contributes on special teams than a starter, and Chris Harris partially tore an ACL in the Broncos' playoff win over San Diego. As a result, the Broncos needed a corner capable of pushing for the starting job opposite Talib, and Roby is a perfect fit for defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio's scheme. He has the fluidity, burst, top-end speed and confidence to blanket receivers one-on-one, as well as the awareness and tackling ability to hold when Del Rio goes zone.   ",4.39,38.5,17.0,124.0,,4.04

His ability to handle and beat pressure also stands out. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> 2011 first-round pick Christian Ponder hasn't panned out, and the Vikings declined his fifth-year option. The short-lived Josh Freeman experiment didn't work out either, and he's signed with the Giants. Matt Cassell is an adequate stopgap, but he isn't the long-term answer. As well as general manager Rick Spielman has drafted overall, it's a quarterback-driven league, and the bottom line is he missed on Ponder. Bridgewater's average arm strength is a concern when it comes playing in the NFC North, but he was the top-ranked quarterback on our board at one point and he's a cerebral quarterback capable of mastering offensive coordinator Norv Turner's offense. There's also a lot to like about Spielman's aggressiveness trading up into the first round to ensure that Houston didn't take Bridgewater with the 33rd overall pick.  ",,30.0,,113.0,7.17,4.2

That said, he has the balance and strength to hold up on an island at guard, where he's capable of being a starter from day one.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> He is a power player with an excellent motor and might fit best inside at guard. Houston's offensive line is making the transition from a zone-blocking scheme to man, which fits his aggressive style.

He can also do a better job of keeping his pads down and getting stronger at the point. The reason he's a good second-round value is his ability to get after the quarterback. He has above-average initial quickness and shows good torso flexibility bending the edge. He doesn't have to win with speed, either. He can generate speed to power, and he has the quick hands to keep offensive tackles off his frame when offensive tackles take away the edge.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a need pick for a defense that desperately craves a pass rush. Both starting ends (Anthony Spencer and George Selvie) are less than ideal. The Cowboys have a deep-seven philosophy, and that needs pass-rush pressure to come from the defensive ends. Dallas used 19 different players on the defensive line a season ago, and it had to blitz to create pressure -- something it wants to avoid doing.

He has adequate arm length (33 7/8"") and the quick kick step to take away the edge, as well as the balance to mirror when defensive ends shoot or redirect inside. He's a relentless run-blocker with enough athletic ability to cover up defenders in a zone scheme and enough power to generate push as a drive blocker when he keeps his pads down, though he's inconsistent in this area. He also shows above-average awareness as a run-blocker and in pass protection.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> He has good versatility and can play both inside and outside. He could fill in at RT or line up at either guard position. While the Browns have shown both man- and zone-blocking schemes a year ago, we will likely see a lot of zone looks in the run game -- and Bitonio has been a very effective zone blocker. The coaches want a little more physicality up front, especially inside, and he will give that to this offense. He actually may have the versatility to line up at all five OL positions.

He's also an accurate short-to-intermediate passer when he's in rhythm and his production at Fresno State was outstanding. He's still a reach this early in the draft, though, and the reason is he doesn't handle pressure. He shows below-average poise and frequently fails to follow through with defenders in his face. In addition, his completion percentage has been inflated by the high percentage of passes he threw within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was a need pick for an offense that has a bridge guy in Matt Schaub, but Oakland's QB position has been a revolving door for years and it needs to solve it soon. Carr fits nicely in the West Coast offense, using short-to-intermediate passes with the ball coming out quickly, leading to YAC. He has enough athletic ability to bootleg and roll out and his big arm fits those vertical shots the Raiders like to take.

However, Hageman comes with bust factor due to some off-the-field character and inconsistent effort on tape. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is an inconsistent defensive line that has talked about moving to a 3-4 look. But the Falcons will likely remain in a 4-3 front this year. Hageman will line up at DT, and when they shift to a 3-4, he can line up at DE. He could also fit nicely in their 3-3-5 packages when they have their DTs on the field.

<b>How he fits:</b> Three of the Bucs' TEs wound up on IR in 2013, and they just didn't get a lot of production out of the position. He is physical enough to help them in edge-blocking in the run game, which they really want, and he will give them a big red zone target.

Plus, he didn't run quite as well as expected. So it's easy to see why his stock has dropped since this time last year. That said, he's a very good value at this point, especially considering Scouts Inc.'s top four receivers are all off the board. Lee is a fluid route runner who changes directions quickly without losing much momentum and accelerates out of cuts. He can also produce after the catch and stretch the field.  Plus, he caught the ball far better his first two seasons at Southern Cal. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Jaguars had to be ecstatic that Lee was still on the board. WR Justin Blackmon has been a disaster off the field, while Cecil Shorts is entering a contract year and has been plagued with durability issues. The other receivers are just complementary players, so the Jags are in trouble when forced into multi-receiver packages.

<b>How he fits:</b> Joyner will likely pair with SS T.J. McDonald and could be a starter from day one. He reminds you of Arizona's Tyrann Mathieu. He might be small but he's a playmaker -- mainly working out of the slot -- and always seems to be around the football.

<b>How he fits:</b> The go-to guys in this pass offense will be Riley Cooper and Jeremy Maclin. But neither guy is an elite receiver in a Chip Kelly offense that loves to spread the field and utilize several of multi-receiver sets. The pace of this passing game is fast and sophisticated, and it requires smart receivers. Matthews fits that description.

While he's on the lighter side and can give some ground in pass protection, he's tough to beat with quickness and he mirrors well.   <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Giants struggled inside on the offensive line a year ago, and they could use an upgrade at guard. He is an excellent zone-blocker with good athletic ability but only adequate power. The Giants run a man-blocking scheme but want to be more physical up front. Richburg probably won't be physical enough to help at guard as a rookie, so his best shot might be at center. He can develop into a steady and reliable performer -- one this line desperately needs.

He's also got the foot speed to reach linebackers at the second level as a run-blocker and redirect in pass protection. However, he's an unfinished product who hasn't realized upside at this point. His footwork is inconsistent in pass protection, and he's a waist-bender who leans and slips off too many run blocks. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Buffalo's offensive line allowed 48 sacks a year ago. Although Kouandjio played left tackle in college, he probably fits best on the right side -- where the Bills needed an upgrade opposite solid left tackle Cordy Glenn. Kouandjio's skill set is terrific, but he can get sloppy in his mechanics. His upside is great, and the Bills will love him if he plays hard every week.

Seattle has several candidates at WR, but with the exception of Percy Harvin, none of them are considered elite.

He's also a powerful pass-rusher with an above-average motor. <br>

<b>How he fits:</b> Running back isn't a pressing need but it's a need for the 49ers. Former second-round pick LaMichael James hasn't panned out and might not be on the roster on opening day. Frank Gore is about to turn 31, and Kendall Hunter is entering the final year of his contract. Hyde is the top back on Scouts Inc.'s board and an excellent value here.  He has the size to handle a heavy workload in the 49ers' run-heavy offense and help keep quarterback Colin Kaepernick upright in pass protection.   ",4.62,34.5,19.0,114.0,,

He's a former receiver who plays the ball well and can make plays in coverage. He can also step up and help out in run support.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Jean-Baptiste has drawn comparisons to Seattle All-Pro Richard Sherman. He was a receiver in the past and has position flexibility, able to play corner or safety. In this Rob Ryan defense, Jean-Baptiste will be a physical press corner. He can play close to the line of scrimmage and challenge receivers, something Ryan will love. His ability to cover without help and reroute receivers will allow this defense to blitz and be aggressive. While he is not a finished product, there is major upside here.

He is a strong hand-fighter who gets quality placement and sustains when able to get into position. He lacks ideal lateral agility, though, and will constantly need to rely on great footwork and proper technique. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Mewhort is a power guy with limited athletic ability. While he can play right tackle, he's probably best fit inside at guard, where the Colts are most vulnerable. The coaches want a better push from their O-line, and Mewhort can give them that. He also fits in their power man-blocking scheme, allowing them to get away from their finesse style of past years. He is what this unit wants to involve into.

He is a bit finesse defending the run and needs to play with better pad level in this area. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is pure value pick late in the second round. The Panthers continue to add talent along the defensive line, which isn't surprising considering general manager Dave Gettleman's background with the Giants.  Ealy brings his most value as a versatile pass-rusher who can move all over the front line to create matchup problems.

However, he's a big target who has the competitiveness, frame and leaping ability to win 50-50 balls. He also has the fluidity to improve as a route runner.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> After adding Marquise Lee early in the second round, the Jaguars continue to add young targets for QB Blake Bortles (third overall pick) to grow with. Lee relies on agility and speed, while Robinson is a big and physical route runner who can win when contested, provides ability after the catch and can be a legit red zone threat for the Jaguars.

He has quick feet and smooth release. In addition, he has the mobility to extend plays with his feet. He must continue to develop his pocket presence, but he has good mental aptitude with which to work. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> With Tom Brady still producing at a high level and a still-developing Ryan Mallett on the roster, another QB wasn't a need for New England. But this pick was all about selecting the best available athlete, and Bill Belichick & Co. love to groom young QBs as future trade bait. Garoppolo has solid physical tools and can make every throw.

He lacks an ideal speed and quickness combo but is a fearless working the middle of the field and has a great feel for the position.  He plays with great effort and has one of the better sets of hands in this class. Landry does the little things right and compares to former Steelers WR Hines Ward.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Dolphins are set on the outside with Mike Wallace and Brian Hartline. By drafting Landry, they now provide QB Ryan Tannehill with a reliable slot receiver who has the toughness and natural feel to thrive in the middle of the field.

He's a below-average pass blocker who gives too much ground to speed to power, doesn't have the length to protect the edge against NFL speed rushers and doesn't mirror all that well. He'll likely have to move inside to guard as a result. He is a better run-blocker who gets into position and generates good initial surge, but he doesn't press defenders, and he slips off too many blocks because of it. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The departure of Breno Giacomini via free agency created an opening at right tackle. Michael Bowie, the 2013 seventh-round pick, started seven games last year and could win the starting job, but bringing in competition makes sense. The Seahawks could also look to upgrade over left guard James Carpenter and right guard J.R. Sweezy, which is why taking Britt makes sense.

He's not much of threat after the catch, but he's fast enough to get down the seam and compete for 50-50 balls downfield. While he drops passes he should catch, he has massive hands (10 inches), and he has shown the ability to make tough catches in traffic.   <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> You could see this pick coming as coach Bill O'Brien loves to employ multiple-tight end sets. Fiedorowicz gives the Texans the option to play more two-TE sets, and he can help in the short to intermediate passing game. He's also a powerful blocker in the run game.

Edge-rushers are going to have a tough time getting around him considering he has 35 5/8-inch arms. He also does a nice job of anchoring and mirroring in pass protection. He can lunge and lean as a run-blocker, but he did a much better job of sustaining and finishing last year than he did in 2012. Finally, he's versatile, as he's got experience at right and left tackle.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Washington has to keep franchise quarterback Robert Griffin III upright and healthy. Finding an upgrade over right tackle Tyler Polumbus, who is entering the final year of his contract, is a step in the right direction. Moses has all the tools to compete for the starting job on day one, and he's an excellent pass-blocker.   ",5.35,21.5,,106.0,7.93,4.95

He'll have to improve is footwork in pass protection and pad level in the run game to succeed in the NFL, but he has the natural ability to develop into an above-average starter at right tackle. He has good arm length (34 inches) and upper-body strength. He presses blockers off his frame in the run game and can stun edge-rushers with a violent punch. At 6-foot-5 and 315 pounds, he also has good quickness and athletic ability. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Dolphins lost four of five starters from the offensive line amid the Richie Incognito fiasco.  They did a nice job of filling the left tackle spot by signing Branden Albert in free agency and now look to Turner to fill the right tackle spot. Turner is a thick individual who should upgrade the run game immediately while he develops his technique in pass protection. ",5.16,28.0,25.0,108.0,7.92,4.71

Southward has a very high ceiling to turn into a quality starter and heavy special-teams contributor if he can continue to develop in terms of instincts. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> William Moore is firmly entrenched as the starter at strong safety, but the Falcons don't have much in the back end after that. Southward fits nicely at free safety and also has some experience at corner. His athletic ability is off the charts, he has solid range and can cover. He is just starting to scratch the surface of his potential. Atlanta plays a lot of sub packages, which will allow Southward to sit back and play a solid center field.

<b>How he fits:</b> By drafting Carlos Hyde in the second round and now taking Martin in the third, the 49ers continue to make sure they stay ahead of the curve with their power run game.  Martin provides instant depth on the interior with the versatility to line up at guard and center.

He also brings added value as special-teams contributor. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This defense switches fronts constantly, although we see it use a lot of 3-4. Kirksey is not really a rush linebacker, but he is good in space and in coverage. He should contribute in sub packages, especially in the Browns' 4-2-5 nickel looks. Kirksley should also help early on special teams.

He's also a tone-setting run defender who plays with good leverage and sets the edge.  <br>

He lacks ideal range but has strong instincts as an interior run-stopper. He has adequate range in underneath zone coverage but lacks ideal playmaking ability and will struggle in man coverage. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a 4-3 defense with some wide-nine schemes that asks its linebackers to play close to the line of scrimmage to attack the gaps.  Brown is a physical thumper who fits what the Bills want to do defensively, but he's probably only a two-down, run-support guy.

He's also an adequate positional blocker who gets into position and walls off defenders.   <br>

He runs polished routes, is highly competitive and brings added value as a special-teams returner. His game reminds us a lot of Steelers WR Antonio Brown. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Brown has to step in at slot WR after the Cardinals lost Andre Roberts in free agency. Arizona likes deep crossing routes, bunch fronts and multi-personnel groupings, and Brown can work the middle of the field and get good separation. Brown is a smart guy who can fill several roles, including being a return specialist, despite his thin frame.

He has a powerful punch and can steer defenders off the ball. He has a prototypical anchor in pass protection but needs to show more patience in his sets. Ideal guard for a power run game. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Turner is more of a power player on an offensive line that uses a zone-blocking scheme. He might not have the athletic ability to be a perfect fit, but his toughness and willingness to battle every down will be a welcome addition in Carolina.

He masks his athletic limitations in pass protection with hand placement and effort. He drives his legs and flashes the ability to generate push in the run game. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Jacksonville's O-line is a mess, yielding 50 sacks in 2013, and it will take some time to fix it. Linder is a good start. He is a smart guy who can play all five positions across the front, giving the Jags the liberty to plug him in early in his career.

He gets good hand placement and anchors well in pass protection, in addition to getting into sound initial position and showing adequate power as a run-blocker.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Broncos need a right tackle after moving Orlando Franklin to guard, and Schofield is a good fit for offensive coordinator Adam Gase's scheme.

He is a tough projection, coming from Georgia Southern's triple-option offense. However, he showed adequate vision, quality balance and agility while showing a quick burst out of cuts. He was one of the big winners at this year's combine. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> McKinnon comes from an option-heavy offense and he lacks ideal size, but his ability to make defenders miss, along with his burst, makes him a very intriguing change-of-pace back behind Adrian Peterson.

His ability to split out and catch the ball (think Dexter McCluster) will help him be productive in several packages. He's a home run threat whenever he gets the ball in his hands -- something Pittsburgh's offense has been missing since Mike Wallace's departure.

While Thomas needs to play with more consistent pad level, he has above-average inline power to steer defenders off the ball in the run game. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a value pick for the 49ers, who are set along the offensive line and can afford to use a redshirt season on Thomas, who's coming off a torn ACL.  If Thomas is able to fully recover, he will bring great value here with the power, length and versatility to interchange between tackle and guard.

He's also a natural pass-catcher capable of developing into a playmaker. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Washington plays a lot of zone coverage because its corners are not really turn-and-run guys. That is in line with Breeland's strengths and skill set. He locates the ball nicely and has good instincts. This defense really needs guys who can create turnovers, and Breeland can help in that area.

He's a better football player than athlete. He's an elite competitor who has above-average vision, is quicker than fast and can contribute on third down.  <br>

He's a small target with small hands, but he consistently extends and snatches the ball out of the air. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This offense lacks receivers who can separate from defenders, as the Jets look to throw a lot of underneath crossing routes and screen passes. This guy should fit nicely in the slot, as he can get away from tight coverage. He can also contribute as a return specialist.

He's still developing as a hand-fighter but has heavy hands and flashes the ability to get off blocks. He projects as a two-down player because he doesn't have the burst to make an impact rushing the passer and wears down quickly.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> A year ago, Oakland was really vulnerable up front and gave up too many plays inside. Ellis, a two-gap space-eater, should help alleviate those issues. He can play DT or NT, but won't add much as a pass-rusher.

<b>How he fits:</b> Free agency and injuries robbed Seattle of some of its depth on the D-line, but Marsh's addition is a step toward restocking it. He is somewhat undersized as an LDE but is a ""try-hard"" guy who fits Pete Carroll's one-gap penetration, attacking scheme.

He's never going to be a high-volume sack player, but he's an adequate bull rusher who flashes the ability to collapse the pocket. <br>

He is also a good on-field leader. The concern with him has to do with his off-field behavioral and maturity issues.</p>
<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> New offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter does an excellent job of adapting his scheme to his personnel, and he knows how to make in-game -- as well as week-to-week -- adjustments. He will put Winston in position to succeed without asking too much of him early, but he prefers to run an up-tempo, no-huddle offense, so he will likely move toward that once Winston gets acclimated to the offense and his teammates.  There's a lot to like from the personnel standpoint, as well.  Wide receiver Mike Evans is a big target who wins 50-50 balls, much like Kelvin Benjamin did for Winston in 2013, plus tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins is a talented receiver whom Koetter is expected to feature.  Seferian-Jenkins gives Winston a potential playmaker over the middle.</p>",4.97,28.5,,103.0,7.16,4.36

He has a strong arm, a quick release, and he is very accurate when throwing on the run. His ability to improve his accuracy and overall efficiency on throws that require anticipation - as he transitions from Oregon's up-tempo spread system to an NFL offense -- will be critical to his success.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Mariota doesn't fit the mold of prototypical pocket passers -- such as Philip Rivers and Ben Roethlisberger -- with whom head coach Ken Whisenhunt has had past success. Whisenhunt will have to adapt his philosophies toward Mariota's dual-threat skill set early on by consistently using his mobility and changing the launch point as he develops as a pocket passer.  The best-case scenario is if Tennessee is able to get quality play from second-year quarterback Zach Mettenberger early on, providing Mariota some time to sit, watch and hone his craft. </p>",4.52,36.0,,121.0,6.87,4.11

He does a good job setting the edge against the run, has a good motor and is versatile enough to play either on the line or in space as a 3-4 outside linebacker.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  Fowler will be used as the LEO within head coach Gus Bradley and defensive coordinator Bob Babich's hybrid system. He will be asked to play multiple roles both from a two- and three-point stance. Fowler has shown the versatility to fill this role both defending the run and adding a pass-rushing presence off the edge. </p>",,,,,,

He suffers from the occasional focus drop but for the most part has excellent ball skills, and he's a good runner after the catch. He's something of a cross between <a href=""http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/11270/jordy-nelson"">Jordy Nelson</a> and <a href=""http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/8442/roddy-white"">Roddy White</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After failing to have a 700-yard receiver last year, the Raiders fill a need while also getting strong value here.  Cooper will immediately provide second-year QB Derek Carr with a reliable option who can both create separation underneath and offer vertical capabilities within offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave's system that implements a lot of play-action. </p>",4.42,33.0,,120.0,6.71,3.98

But we wouldn't count out his chances of making it as an NFL tackle, and at worst he projects as an excellent guard. He has very good strength and quickness, and he's the toughest offensive lineman in the 2015 class. He's a tone-setter with a nasty disposition.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Washington had one of the worst offensive lines in the league last year, so it has done well to add one of the best offensive line coaches in the league in Bill Callahan and the best offensive linemen in the draft in Scherff. It's a little unclear where Scherff will line up, considering guard is a pressing need and 2014 third-round pick Morgan Moses struggled at right tackle last year, but Scherff should be a day-one starter regardless of where he plays. </p>",5.05,,23.0,,,

He is an outstanding run defender who also has good quickness, strength and a variety of moves as a pass-rusher. He has a good motor and plays with an edge.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Williams is strictly a value pick here, he's our top-rated defensive prospect. He adds immediate depth as a 5-technique behind Sheldon Richardson and Muhammad Wilkerson, who has been on the trading block. Williams also has the versatility to line up in multiple spots along the defensive line, giving first-year head coach Todd Bowles the flexibility to jump into a four-man front when necessary.</p>",,,,,,

He struggled to catch the ball at times in 2013 but displayed outstanding ball skills last season. His best trait is his ability to win one-on-one battles vertically and in the red zone.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> New offensive coordinator Adam Gase's timing offense requires precise route runners -- and that's one area in which White needs to improve -- but he fills the void created by trading Brandon Marshall to the Jets. Similar to Marshall, White will provide a downfield matchup problem with his size, strength and ability to create late separation, and combined with Alshon Jeffery continue to provide big play-ability outside the hashes for Jay Cutler. </p>",4.35,36.5,23.0,123.0,6.92,4.14

But the complete lack of a power element to his game is a major concern.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Beasley will be used in the hybrid LEO role within head coach Dan Quinn and defensive coordinator Richard Smith's hybrid base 4-3 scheme.  Beasley will play in both a two- and three-point stance. where Smith will look to get him one-on-one matchups in passing situations to help improve a pass-rush that was tied for 30th in the league with 22 sacks. </p>",4.53,41.0,35.0,130.0,6.91,4.15

He has some work to do on his hand placement and technique, but overall he's an effective blocker with excellent toughness and intangibles. He's most likely a right tackle in the NFL but could develop into a left.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Second-year offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo's system requires a quality run/pass balance. Flowers is one of the better inline blocking tackles in this class and immediately upgrades the New York's size and power on the front line. Flowers will potentially start his career inside at guard before making the transition outside as either a right or left tackle.  </p>",5.31,,37.0,,,
901,46817,Todd Gurley,RB,222,72.625,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> Durability is a concern with Gurley, as he's coming off of a torn ACL. But if he can stay healthy he could wind up as one of the best players in this entire class. He's a downhill runner with elite power and balance to go with outstanding breakaway speed. The most underrated part of his game is his pass-catching ability - he has very good hands and is quick to accelerate upfield after the catch.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Gurley is strictly a value pick here. Having played against Marshawn Lynch twice a year, coach Jeff Fisher knows what having a dynamic, big-play runner like Gurley can do for an offense. While Gurley likely won't be fully healthy until the second half of the 2015 season, he will provide a workhorse for first-year offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti, who holds a run-to-set-up-the-pass philosophy. </p>",4.52,,17.0,,,

He played most of his snaps in press-man coverage at Michigan State, and is likely best-suited for a similar role or Cover 2 in the NFL. He's aggressive and physical in run support.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  Head coach Mike Zimmer and defensive coordinator George Edwards run aggressive man schemes and value physical press corners with the ability to reroute receivers, making Wayne an excellent fit here. He has all the tools and the technique to push aging free-agent signing Terrence Newman for a starting role on the outside and develop into an ideal complement to 2013 first-round pick Xavier Rhodes. </p>",4.31,38.0,19.0,122.0,7.06,4.39
903,46823,Danny Shelton,DT,339,74.125,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He's a prototypical two-gap nose tackle with a thick frame and excellent power. He commands double teams and makes plays against the run, and is an improving pass-rusher who can push the pocket and is light on his feet for a 339-pound nose tackle. He plays with an edge and good effort and stamina for a guy his size.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Shelton adds size and depth to the interior defensive line and is arguably the best run-stopping defensive lineman in this class. He is insurance for DT Phil Taylor, who is coming off of knee surgery and entering a contract year. Shelton is a quality fit in defensive coordinator Jim O'Neil's hybrid scheme and should immediately help a Browns run defense that allowed a league-high 141.6 yards per game. </p>",5.64,30.5,34.0,95.0,7.99,4.65

He's a very good run-blocker with good power and a quick first step, and he generally shows good recognition skills. We would have liked to have seen more of a nasty side from him at Stanford.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> Offensive tackle doesn't appear to  be a pressing need at first glance, but left tackle Terron Armstead has had some problems staying healthy and Peat is an excellent value at this point. The Saints could also kick Peat or one of their other tackles inside to guard, where they have a pressing need.  ",5.18,31.0,,105.0,8.01,4.62

He has good overall ball skills and was very productive at Louisville, particularly on deep routes.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Dolphins fill a need here and continue to add weapons, attempting to aid the development of QB Ryan Tannehill. Parker provides a wide catch radius and big-play target outside the hashes next to WRs Greg Jennings and Kenny Stills, who will likely line up in the slot. </p>",4.45,36.5,17.0,125.0,,
906,46826,Melvin Gordon,RB,215,72.625,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> Gordon possesses excellent vision and patience as a runner, then does a great job of quickly accelerating through the hole once it opens, and watching the second level to exploit cutback lanes. He'll win most foot races once he's in the open field. He needs to improve his ball security as well as his pass-protection and pass-catching abilities.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Chargers were battered by injuries at running back last year, including Ryan Matthews (who is now with Philadelphia).  Gordon provides a major upgrade over Danny Woodhead and Branden Oliver and has the skill set to fit within both a zone- and man-blocking system, which first-year offensive coordinator Frank Reich will utilize. </p>",4.52,35.0,19.0,126.0,7.04,4.07

He can get out-muscled by bigger receivers at times and have trouble getting off blocks in run defense due to his lean frame, so he could afford to get stronger.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  Johnson will add depth behind Kareem Jackson and Jonathan Joseph on the outside. He is a strong fit here with the versatility to line up in defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel's scheme, which requires cornerbacks to line up in multiple roles, including both zone and man technique. </p>",4.52,41.5,,130.0,6.79,3.89
908,46821,Arik Armstead,DE,292,79.125,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He is an outstanding run defender with his elite combination of size, length and power. He didn't produce much as a pass-rusher but offers good upside in that area, and he was much more disruptive at moving quarterbacks off their spots than his low sack totals would indicate. His motor was a little up and down at Oregon.</p>
<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Justin Smith's decision whether or not to retire will have a big impact here. The 49ers also signed Darnell Dockett, and 2013 second-round pick Tank Carradine could take the next step this year. However, the 34-year-old Dockett is coming off a season-ending ACL injury, and Carradine, who sat out his rookie season recovering from his own ACL injury, played in only nine games last year. In addition, Armstead's ability to anchor against the run at 5-technique and reduce inside to rush the passer makes him a good fit for new defensive coordinator Eric Mangini, who values versatility. </p>",5.06,34.0,24.0,117.0,7.57,4.53
909,46830,Marcus Peters,CB,197,71.625,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> His behavioral history is a major concern. He was dismissed from the UW football program in 2014 after several incidents including run-ins with coaches. But based purely on the tape he might be the best cornerback in this class, with very good athletic ability, size strength and playmaking instincts. He's best in press coverage.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  This is strictly a value pick here. Coach Andy Reid and general manager John Dorsey felt the risk was worth the reward regarding Peters' character concerns. Peters is a perfect fit in defensive coordinator Bob Sutton's system that utilizes a heavy dose of press-man technique.  Peters is a projection pick who fills the potential void of CB Sean Smith, who is entering a contract year. </p>",4.53,37.5,17.0,121.0,7.08,4.08
910,46825,Cameron Erving,C,313,77.5,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> Erving excelled at center after moving over from left tackle midway through the 2014 season. He's a great athlete for the center position with his length and quickness, and his versatility to play multiple spots along the line is a huge asset. He's a good run-blocker but even better in pass protection.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Erving adds depth and, most importantly, versatility along the offensive line. He will likely start his career at right guard next to OC Alex Mack and OG Joel Bitonio, giving the Browns one of the better offensive lines in the league. This also is in an attempt to continue to enhance the run game and take pressure off of QB Josh McCown or Johnny Manziel, whoever starts behind center. </p>",5.15,30.5,30.0,112.0,7.48,4.63
911,46832,Nelson Agholor,WR,198,72.125,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He doesn't have elite explosiveness, but he's a smooth and sudden athlete with good route-running ability to gain separation from coverage. He'll never be a big-play threat on contested catch situations, but he's a quick and decisive runner after the catch and as a returner. He has the versatility to fill multiple roles in an offense.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Eagles fill one of their most pressing needs with this pick, and though Agholor is the No. 2 receiver left on our board at this point, he's a safer pick than UCF's Breshad Perriman. Agholor's ability to line up on the outside, work out of the slot and even work out of the backfield will make it easier for Chip Kelly to create favorable matchups without having to make substitutions. He also bolsters an already strong Eagles return game.  ",4.42,,12.0,,,

He has an outstanding combination of length and quickness, including excellent mobility as a zone blocker, and he has very good awareness.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  Ogbuehi is a pick for the future, as LT Andrew Whitworth will turn 34 this season and both he and RT Andre Smith are entering contract years.  This is ideal scenario for Ogbuehi, who doesn't have to play right away this season and can be patient rehabbing his knee injury. </p>",4.98,,23.0,,,
913,46833,Bud Dupree,OLB,269,76.0,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> Dupree is an elite athlete who has great range against the run and the ability to drop in coverage as a 3-4 outside linebacker. He offers upside as a pass-rusher due to his raw tools, but he needs to add polish in terms of his moves and finishing ability. He also needs to get more consistent at the point of attack.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  With Jarvis Jones off to a slow start to his career and James Harrison already 37 years old, the Steelers fill value and need here with Dupree at outside linebacker in Keith Butler's 3-4 scheme.  The Steelers are hoping Dupree can help inject a pass-rushing presence off the edge for a Pittsburgh team that notched just 33 sacks last year, its lowest total since 1989. </p>",,,,,,
914,46840,Shane Ray,OLB,245,74.625,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He's a relentless pass-rusher with elite first-step quickness, snap anticipation and overall instincts. His range against the run is outstanding, and he does a great job of locating the ball. The concerns we have with him are the lack of a significant power element in his game, the fact that he'll struggle against bigger, stronger OTs, and his lack of experience dropping in coverage.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips inherited two of the best edge rushers in business in Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware (whom he coached in Dallas).  However, Miller is scheduled to hit free agency following the 2015 season, and Ware, who turns 33 in July, underwent elbow surgery last year. If Ray can get and stay healthy, stay out of trouble off the field and develop into a productive pass-rusher as expected, it will have been worth it to trade up and get him. </p>",,,,,,
915,46841,D.J. Humphries,OT,307,77.0,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He might have the best movement skills of any offensive tackle in this class, and he's best-suited for a team that runs a zone-blocking scheme that takes advantage of that quickness and athleticism and masks his lack of ideal power, particularly as a run-blocker.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> This is an intriguing pick considering Arizona allowed just 28 sacks last year, the team's fewest since 2009 (26). Plus, the Cardinals need to improve their ground game and upgrade over right offensive tackle Bobby Massie. Humphries is a left tackle who is better in pass protection than he is run blocking, so it will be interesting to see of the Cardinals move Jared Veldheer to the right side. Humphries isn't a bad value at this point, though, and the Cardinals needed to address an offense that finished 24th in scoring last year.</p>

He lacks ideal size as a linebacker but is an excellent mover in space who can cover sideline to sideline against the run. He's also a good tackler and has above-average man-to-man coverage skills against running backs and tight ends.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> Defensive coordinator Sean McDermott can play Thompson at linebacker when he goes to his nickel package, as he often does, and line up Thompson at safety in run-heavy situations.  Thompson should also strengthen Carolina's special teams, and he could fill in at running back in an emergency.  However, Carolina has more pressing needs, and Thompson doesn't have a natural position fit at the NFL level, making him significant reach at this point.",4.64,33.5,,117.0,6.99,4.08
917,46829,Breshad Perriman,WR,212,74.0,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> On the one hand, Perriman is an outstanding big-play threat with his combination of size and speed, and he brought down a lot of really difficult catches on 50-50 balls. On the other hand, his 14 percent college drop percentage is a major red flag when combined with the issues he had catching some routine passes on tape. The upside is there with him, but so is the risk.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> After losing Torrey Smith to San Francisco, the Ravens were in dire need of finding a big-play, vertical threat on the outside. Perriman fits the bill, as his size-and-speed combination tailor very well with QB Joe Flacco's arm under first-year offensive coordinator Mark Trestman, who likes to dial up plenty of vertical shots off of play-action.

His anticipation and recognition skills are just average, but his size, fluidity and range make up for it. There are a lot of tools to work with here. He could play either corner or free safety at the next level.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong>  Dallas fills one of its most pressing needs and adds a player who fits its scheme in Jones, who is a good value at this point. Jones has the size and range to excel in defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli's Cover 2 looks, in addition to the fluidity to hold up when Marinelli mixes in man looks. ",4.43,44.5,,147.0,6.78,3.94

So if you're drafting Tomlinson, you're drafting a right guard. He's not a great athlete but is the best of this year's guard class, and he's a very powerful run-blocker with road-grader capabilities.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> The Lions have a pressing need at guard, and Tomlinson, who is the best pure guard on our board, is a plug-and-play starter. Still, it's hard to be overly complimentary about this pick. Taking Tomlinson, who projected as a late-second-round pick based on our evaluation, this early is a reach. It's also somewhat surprising they didn't address the defensive tackle position, considering that it's also a need and Texas defensive tackle Malcolm Brown was still on the board.

He's also a very natural pass-catcher. He needs to refine his route-running technique.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After adding WR Andre Johnson and RB Frank Gore in free agency, general manager Ryan Grigson continues to surround Andrew Luck with weapons.  Offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton now has a pair of speedsters on the perimeter in Dorsett and T.Y. Hilton -- and both can also line up in the slot. Dorsett also eases concerns over the potential loss of Hilton, who is entering a contract year and might not be able to be retained with Luck's big contract looming. </p>",4.33,37.0,13.0,122.0,6.7,4.11

He has the quickness to hold up on underneath routes and the deep speed to recover from a missed step. He's a playmaker. His range and effort in run support are very good, but he needs to improve against the run overall.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Safety isn't a pressing need, but Green Bay defensive coordinator Dom Capers runs a lot of sub packages and Randall is a tweener safety/corner who projects best at nickelback.

But he has very good pop as a tackler and rare straight-line speed for his size that allows him to make a lot of plays outside the tackle box and when tracking down ball carriers from behind.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> New Orleans had to strengthen the defensive front after finishing 29th in rushing defense last year, and playing the run is what Anthony does best. The Saints traded for Dannell Ellerbe, but he's not an upgrade over Curtis Lofton, whom the Saints made a cap casualty (plus Ellerbe and David Hawthorne both had to take pay cuts). With that in mind, the expectation should be that Anthony is a Week 1 starter.  </p>",4.56,37.0,23.0,122.0,7.07,4.03

He also plays with very good effort. He's just an average pass-rusher at this point, as he lacks the ideal first-step quickness to penetrate gaps and need to rely upon his power.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Patriots were very fortunate to have Brown fall to them at 32. With longtime NT Vince Wilfork departing for Houston via free agency and 2014 first-round pick Dominique Easley coming off of another knee injury, Brown helps solidify a big need on the interior, while also being a strong fit as New England continues to transitions to a primary base 4-3 front. </p>",5.05,29.5,26.0,98.0,7.84,4.59

He'll have trouble in coverage if he has to match up one-on-one against slot receivers with regularity, but he's athletic enough to cover most running backs and tight ends.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The only safeties on the Giants roster heading into the draft were 2013 fifth-round pick Cooper Taylor and 2014 fifth-round pick Nate Berhe, so this was their most pressing need. They fill it by taking the best safety on our board in Collins. In addition, the Giants need to bolster a run defense that finished 30th in the league last year, and Collins is at his best stopping the run. </p>

But he is a very powerful blocker in both the running and passing games.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Buccaneers got a potential franchise quarterback in the first round and now they address their second-most-pressing need at offensive tackle. While we have Pittsburgh's T.J. Clemmings and Oregon's Jake Fisher ranked higher on our board, Smith has all the tools to improve an offensive line that played a big role in the Buccaneers allowing 52 sacks (tied for third most) and averaging 3.9 yards/rush (24th) last year.</p>",5.27,32.0,26.0,109.0,7.95,4.79

He has the versatility to play at different spots along different fronts. He's a tough player, but his effort is up and down, and there's a concern over how significantly his weight has fluctuated.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Edwards brings a lot of versatility to the table with the ability to line up on the edge, as well as reduce inside in first-year defensive coordinator Ken Norton's 4-3 scheme.

Where he excels is with his lateral agility and acceleration off his cuts. He's very good at making a quick jump cut in the backfield to elude a defender and then explode through the hole. He is solid as a pass-catcher and in protection, but has room to improve.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  After signing TE Julius Thomas, Jacksonville continues to surround its second-year quarterback Blake Bortles with offensive weapons. Yeldon is a great fit within first-year offensive coordinator Greg Olson's heavy zone-blocking scheme. Yeldon shows excellent vision, patience and lateral agility to stick his foot in the ground and get vertical when he finds a crease. </p>",4.61,36.0,22.0,117.0,7.19,4.22

He was less consistent on short and intermediate routes, and his effort and toughness are question marks.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Jets find a vertical receiver here who can stretch the field and create space for newly acquired WR Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker to work underneath.  Smith's ability to be a big-play threat will also help prevent defenses from consistently dropping a safety in the box to defend the run game.  First-year general manager Mike Maccagnan has now surrounded Geno Smith with plenty of weapons, and the Jets will quickly find out if he is the QB of the future next season.</p>",4.42,39.0,10.0,122.0,,4.15

His best attribute is as a run defender, but he's an effective power rusher, especially when moved inside to defensive tackle on passing downs.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> It will be interesting to see how new defensive coordinator Joe Barry uses the versatile Smith. He projects best a defensive end in Barry's scheme based on the tape, but he's capable of lining up at outside linebacker based on the way he tested, and he's an excellent pass-rusher when he reduces inside. New general manger Scot McCloughan gets a player who bolsters the defensive front regardless of where he plays, and McCloughan  has done a good job of getting better in the trenches on both sides of the ball with his first two picks.   </p>",4.74,34.0,24.0,121.0,7.07,4.28

He has a very powerful upper body and can take on double teams, and his overall effort and motor are good.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> New Chicago general manager Ryan Pace addressed the teams' two most pressing needs with his first two picks. Goldman is a perfect fit at nose tackle in Vic Fangio's 3-4 defense, which mixes it up with one- and two-gap schemes. He's an excellent value at this point in the draft and he should help bolster a Bears run defense that finished 17th in the league last year. </p>

His route-running skills are a work in progress, but the primary concerns with him are off the field, as he was kicked off the Missouri football team following several behavioral issues and he missed the entire 2014 season after transferring to Oklahoma.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  After selecting his QB of the future in Marcus Mariota, coach Ken Whinsenhunt is looking surround him with weapons. Green-Beckham is one the bigger boom-or-bust prospects in this class but has the size and measureables to win in contested situations and gives the Titans a legit red zone threat they have been lacking. </p>",4.49,33.5,13.0,119.0,6.89,4.45
932,46849,Devin Funchess,WR,232,76.25,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He is something of a hybrid between a wide receiver and an ""F"" tight end, with a rare combination of length, speed, fluidity and body control. He has trouble separating on shorter routes, but he's a matchup problem in the red zone and on vertical routes. His ball skills declined during the 2014 season as Michigan's offense struggled.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Carolina needed a No. 2 receiver to complement last year's first-round pick Kelvin Benjamin, and Funchess has the potential to develop into that player, but this is still somewhat of a surprising pick. The Panthers traded up to get him, yet they still have a pressing need at offensive tackle, and Pittsburgh's T.J. Clemmings and Oregon's Jake Fisher are still on the board. </p>",4.7,38.5,17.0,122.0,,

His instincts are above-average and he plays with good discipline, but he needs to do a better job of finishing plays.</p>
<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Falcons had to address their league-worst pass defense last year, and they've done just that with their first two picks. Collins is a good value at this point, plus he's an excellent fit in head coach Dan Quinn and defensive coordinator Richard Smith's press  zone-heavy scheme. He should push Robert Alford for the starting role opposite Desmond Trufant.</p>",4.48,36.0,,124.0,6.77,4.27

His movement skills are a little stiff, but he has very good straight-line speed and closing burst against the run, and he's fearless in taking on blocks. He has good upside as a pass-rusher but needs to get better in coverage.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Houston looks to solidify the middle of their defense with this selection. Brian Cushing has had a slew of durability issues and the ILB spot has been a revolving door since DeMeco Ryans left. McKinney has quality instincts and is the physical thumper that defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel is looking for in his base 3-4 scheme. </p>

He won't win often with pure speed but he has enough quickness to get offensive tackles honest, and explosive power in his upper body to convert speed to power. He is also an outstanding finisher, unlike some of the other edge-rusher prospects in this class.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> New Orleans finished with 34 sacks (25th overall) and the 25th-ranked pass defense, so adding a pass-rusher like Kikaha was a priority. Defensive coordinator Rob Ryan keeps offenses off balance by varying his looks and playing games up front, so he's capable of creating favorable one-on-one matchups for Kikaha on passing downs. Kikaha should also help improve a run defense that finished 28th in the league last year. </p>",4.93,,,,,

He lacks ideal size and power for the position in run defense, but he makes up for it with very good overall range and his quick diagnosis of plays. He's a playmaker against both the run and the pass.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Vikings were in the market for  an inside linebacker to replace Jasper Brinkley, who signed with Dallas, and improve a run defense that finished 25th in the league last year. They get their man in Kendricks, who is the top inside linebacker on our board and will line up next to 2014 first-round pick Anthony Barr giving the Vikings a young, talented linebacker corps. Kendricks also has the cover skills to hold up in coverage in Minnesota's man-heavy scheme.  </p>",4.61,38.0,19.0,124.0,,

He can be a good run defender and playmaker against the half, but he needs to improve his discipline and do a better job of finishing plays.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> This is a surprise, considering the 49ers drafted Eric Reid in the first round in 2013 and Jimmie Ward in the first round last year and Antone Bethea made the Pro Bowl. Tartt is a substantial reach at this point. However, Ward is a hybrid corner safety at his best playing the nickelback role, and Bethea turns 31 this year. Tartt has excellent upside, and new defensive coordinator Eric Mangini should have time to bring him along without asking too much of him early on.   </p>",4.53,,,124.0,,
938,46863,Eric Rowe,CB,205,72.75,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He has very good size and length for the cornerback position, and figures to be a press corner or free safety in the NFL. He's a little tight in his movements, so he can struggle to stay with receivers in and out of their breaks. He's a very physical run defender.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Eagles allowed 21 passing touchdowns to receivers last year, which tied for third most in NFL, and they had already started to rebuild the secondary heading into the draft. Bradley Fletcher and Cary Williams are both gone.  They signed Byron Maxwell and Walter Thurmond, but Thurmond signed a one-year deal and Brandon Boykin is a better nickelback than starter on the outside. Rowe is a perfect fit at corner in this press-zone heavy scheme and the Eagles also have a need at safety where he could line up if they feel he can help them there. </p>",4.45,39.0,19.0,125.0,6.7,3.97

His range against the run is better than you'd expect based on his speed because he has very good instincts and diagnostic skills. He was the quarterback of the Hurricanes' defense.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> This is a value pick from San Diego and doesn't hit a major need.  Manti Te'o has had problems staying healthy next to Donald Butler on the interior, and Perryman will instantly add depth and toughness there. </p>",4.78,32.0,27.0,113.0,,

He's very physical at the point of attack.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Morse played left tackle at Missouri but has the versatility to bump inside at either guard or center, where he will likely fit in Kansas City. He takes solid angles and does a nice job of sustaining blocks, which fits well within offensive coordinator Doug Pederson's zone-blocking scheme. Morse also upgrades the toughness along Kansas City's offensive line.  </p>",5.14,31.0,36.0,112.0,7.6,4.5

But he has the fluidity and top-end speed to turn and run with the fastest receivers -- his movement skills remind us of Janoris Jenkins.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Darby has one of best pure cover skills in this year's cornerback class and is a strong fit within Dennis Thurman's press-man scheme.  Darby has the mirror skills to hold up on an island, which is exactly what Rex Ryan wants to execute the heavy amount of blitz packages he traditionally dials up. </p>",4.38,41.5,12.0,129.0,6.94,4.14

He's strong at the point of attack for an outside linebacker prospect, but he has limited experience dropping in coverage and doesn't have great speed to play in space.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Paul Kruger was the only OLB to have more than two sacks in 2014, which includes 2013 first-round pick Barkevious Mingo (2 sacks). Orchard brings a speed to power element and provides Jim O'Neil with another edge-rushing presence. Cleveland continues to bolster their front seven after losing Jabaal Sheard to free agency to combat the talented backs and strong rushing attacks within the division. </p>",,,,,,

There are only so many human beings his size who can move like he does. But he was completely unreliable at Oklahoma in terms of his on-field effort, particularly on passing plays.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After signing Ndamukong Suh, the Dolphins continue to add size and power on the interior with Phillips. The hope for defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle is that Suh can light a fire under Phillips, who has an extremely high ceiling, but inconsistencies on tape prevented him from reaching his potential at Oklahoma. </p>",5.17,30.0,28.0,105.0,7.88,4.68

He's an adequate run-blocker in zone-blocking schemes who can take advantage of that athleticism; however, his power base is just average, so he can struggle versus stronger run defenders.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Bengals continue to stock pile the offensive line, with both LT Andrew Whitworth and RT Andre Smith becoming free agents after next season. This makes sense to ensure they continue to create room for a pair of the talented young runners in Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard while making sure they don't have to put too much on the shoulders of QB Andy Dalton. </p>",5.01,32.5,25.0,,7.25,4.33

He runs angry. He is also the best back in this class at getting in and out of creases. Some backs have elite agility but can't sense holes opening up in time, while others have the instincts but not the quickness to take advantage of it. Abdullah has a rare combination of both. He's a good pass-catcher, but needs to improve his ball security.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Lions released Reggie Bush. Theo Riddick could play a bigger role in the passing game with Bush moving, but he's a better receiver than runner. Joique Bell has had problems staying healthy, and he's averaged fewer than 4 yards per carry the past two seasons, so this was a pressing need. In addition, Abdullah is the top back on our board at this point, and he's a good fit for offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi's zone-heavy scheme. Still, this is a bit of a risky pick considering Abdullah isn't built like a bell cow, he's been banged up in the past and the Lions might need him to carry a heavy workload.</p>",4.6,42.5,24.0,130.0,6.79,3.95

He has excellent ball skills and enough speed to stretch the seam vertically, and he generally does a good job of separating from coverage. He gives good effort as a blocker but does better in space than when lined up on the line.</p>

<p><p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Ravens continue to add weapons for Joe Flacco.  With Owen Daniels leaving via free agency and Dennis Pitta missing the majority of the past two seasons with a hip injury, Williams has the size and athleticism to flourish with Flacco, who is at his best when he has a big target down the middle of the field. </p>",4.78,34.5,17.0,117.0,7.3,4.37

His cover skills are excellent, with his explosiveness and quickness, but he can get exposed by bigger receivers at times.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Steelers fill another big need on defense with Golson. After notching just 11 interceptions last season, they needed to find a playmaker in the back end. Golson, who has excellent anticipation skills and production (9 INTs in 2014), will help upgrade them in that department. </p>",4.46,33.5,15.0,120.0,6.81,4.2

He has good strength as a run-blocker and good awareness to locate assignments.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  St. Louis needs to improve an offensive line after it allowed sacks on 8.7 percent of dropbacks against four or fewer pass-rushers last season, highest in the NFL, and  allowed pressure (sack or duress) on 33 percent of dropbacks last season, third-highest in the NFL. Havenstein is a bit of a reach at this point, and he's a better run-blocker than pass-blocker, but his ability to move defenders off the ball in this power-heavy scheme should benefit first-round-pick running back Todd Gurley. Plus, he's adequate enough in pass protection to hold up on the right side, where he projects.  </p>",5.46,28.5,16.0,96.0,8.28,4.87

He's a bit of a tweener, however, as he doesn't have elite strength to play defensive end and doesn't have much experience as a 3-4 outside linebacker. But he's a tone-setter with an outstanding motor.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Arizona wanted to get faster at linebacker coming into the draft, and while Golden has average timed top-end speed, there's still a lot to like about this pick. He's a good value pick at this point thanks in large part to his ability to get after the quarterback. The Cardinals finished with 35 sacks last year, the team's lowest amount since 2010.  </p>",,,,,,

He holds up well against speed rushers when his footwork is sound, and he's a good second-level blocker on running plays, but has just average power.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Sambrailo helps fill the void left by the departure of Orlando Franklin. Sambrailo likely projects at right tackle to start his career, which will allow Louis Vasquez to bump back inside, where he is at his best. Continuing to infuse talent on the front line is a wise decision to make sure QB Peyton Manning is protected in his later years. </p>",5.36,29.0,23.0,97.0,7.54,4.58

His inability to add and keep weight is a concern, as is his off-field history. He'll need to get stronger against the run. But he can be a difference-maker as a pass-rusher if he does what he needs to off the field.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> Dallas finished with just 28 sacks (28th) last season, and no player had more than six. The Cowboys also finished 27th in third-down percentage (43.6) in 2014, so improving the pass rush was a priority. While they have already signed Greg Hardy, he is appealing a 10-game suspension, making it important they find a difference-maker like Gregory has the potential to be.

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Packers still have Sam Shields, Casey Hayward and nickelback Micah Hyde after losing Tramon Williams and Davon House, but they needed help on the back end. The relatively inexperienced Rollins is a good value here and he's got the tools to excel in the Packers' press-man scheme once he gets acclimated and improves his overall technique. So, taking him when they don't need him to play a substantial role early makes sense.  </p>",4.57,36.5,14.0,122.0,7.1,4.28

There are significant concerns about his behavior off the field though. Michigan dismissed Clark two days after he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor domestic violence and assault in November.  He recently pleaded down to disorderly conduct in that case but it's still a major concern and it's not his first off-the-field incident. Authorities charged him with second-degree home invasion in 2012. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Bruce Irvin had only 8.5 sacks last year, and Seattle declined to pick up his fifth-year option. The versatile Clark represents his potential replacement. </p>",4.79,38.5,19.0,118.0,7.08,4.05

A team captain and three-year starter, Richards has the range to cover a deep half and physical presence over the middle. He also has above-average ball skills and flashes the ability to make plays in coverage. On the down side, he doesn't have the cover skills to stick with NFL slot receivers in man and doesn't get off blocks well enough to regularly line up in the box. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Richards has the character, intelligence and instincts that fit what New England is looking for in the secondary. He will likely be groomed as Patrick Chung's replacement at SS, where he will be an upgrade in coverage. </p>",4.65,32.0,13.0,111.0,6.74,4.22

His production dropped off his senior year, but generally he is effective at defending the ball. He's solid in run support but needs to get stronger.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Vontae Davis and Greg Toler are slated starters for next year in Indianapolis, but Smith will bring quality depth. This makes sense, considering Toler is a free agent after next season. Smith has the instincts and versatility to play both outside the hashes, as well as bump inside to the slot, where he will likely see most of his playing time early in his career. </p>",4.37,36.0,18.0,124.0,6.96,4.26

His effort is up and down, but when he's aggressive, he can dominate at the point of attack and drive defensive linemen off the ball in the running game.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> The Titans continue to cater to Mariota by addressing the offensive line. Poutasi played left tackle at Utah but likely projects as a right tackle or at guard in the NFL. While he lacks ideal athleticism, he brings the size and inline power offensive coordinator Jason Michael is looking for in his offensive linemen. </p>",5.32,26.5,26.0,95.0,8.09,4.89

He works hard in the film room, and it transfers to the field.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After taking RB T.J. Yeldon in the second round, the Jaguars continue to try to help improve their 21st-ranked rushing attack. Cann has ample experience at the highest level of competition and instantly upgrades the interior of this offensive line. The hope is the Jaguars can find more balance on offense, which in turn will help QB Blake Bortles and lower their league-high 71 sacks surrendered in 2014. </p>",5.47,,26.0,,,

His ball skills were much improved as a senior, as was his blocking.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Raiders continue to bring in young weapons for their second-year quarterback, Derek Carr. Walford is the most complete tight end in this class and has reliable hands in traffic to provide Carr with a target over the middle.  After lacking playmakers on the perimeter last year, Carr now has two young receiving threats in Walford and WR Amari Cooper to grow with.  </p>",4.79,35.0,20.0,120.0,7.32,4.57

But he is one of our favorite players in this entire class because of his quickness, acceleration and top-end speed, elusiveness in the open field and excellent ball skills.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Doug Baldwin led Seattle with 825 yards receiving in 2014, which ranked 42nd in the NFL in receiving yards -- and no Seahawks WR other than Baldwin caught more than 38 passes. Further complicating matters is that 2014 second-round pick Paul Richardson (ACL) might not be ready for the start of the season. Seattle needed help at receiver and Lockett is a potential difference-maker. He's also capable of giving the return game a much-needed boost. </p>",4.4,35.5,,121.0,6.89,4.07

Most of his separation from coverage happens late, because he lacks ideal quickness to separate on shorter routes.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Strong is the big-bodied replacement the Texans are looking for to fill the void left by Andre Johnson. Strong brings great value here and will be a strong complement for DeAndre Hopkins outside the hashes, with the ability to win in one-on-one contested situations. </p>",4.44,42.0,,123.0,,

His ideal fit is for a zone-blocking scheme. He plays with an edge and with good effort.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> General manager Ryan Pace did a  nice job of signing Will Montgomery, who played for new offensive coordinator Adam Gase in Denver, after releasing Robert Garza,  but Montgomery is clearly not the long-term answer. They signed him to one-year deal, and he's 32 years old. That said, there's no pressure on Grasu to make an immediate impact, but the hope is he pushes for the starting role when the time comes to replace Montgomery.  </p>",5.03,,,,,
962,47001,Jamon Brown,OT,323,75.625,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> One of Brown's greatest strengths is his versatility, as the three-year starter played offensive guard, right tackle and left tackle at Louisville. He has the length and frame to provide depth at all the positions at the NFL level early on his career. He appears to have some upside, as he performed better during agility drills than expected at his pro day. However, he needs to do a better job of sinking his hips and staying square when he's forced to change directions in pass protection. He also has to play with better leverage in the run game.  </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> General manager Les Snead continues to address the offensive line, and for good reason. Brown is expected to kick inside to guard, where the Rams have a pressing need, but it's worth noting that Brown is a substantial reach. The Rams could have still filled this need without reaching as far as they did. </p>",5.08,,,,,
963,46875,Tevin Coleman,RB,206,71.375,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He isn't a power back and his lateral agility isn't great, but he has above-average vision and patience and is a home run threat because of his elite acceleration and top-end speed. He reminds us some of Chris Johnson and Jamaal Charles in terms of his skill set and body type.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> Atlanta ranks 31st in NFL in rushing yards per game (86.3) over the past three seasons. The Falcons released Steven Jackson (who had 1,250 yards and averaged 3.6 yards per carry in two seasons with the Falcons), Jacquizz Rodgers left in free agency and 2014 fourth-round pick Devonta Freeman will likely play a bigger role, but he's not a difference-maker. Coleman's vision and burst make him a good fit for new offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan's zone-heavy scheme. </p>",4.4,,22.0,,,
964,46864,Owa Odighizuwa,DE,267,75.5,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> He is an extremely competitive and relentless player who is excellent against the run and versatile enough to play multiple roles in multiple defensive fronts. He's not a great pass-rusher at this point but has the upside to develop into one with his upper-body power, violent hands and closing burst.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Giants placed the franchise tag on Jason Pierre-Paul, so they don't have a long-term deal in place. Cullen Jenkins is 34, Robert Ayers is coming off a season-ending injury, and while 2013 third-round pick Damontre Moore made strides last year, he has yet to start a game. In addition,  Steve Spagnuolo has returned at defensive coordinator. He relies on his front four to generate pressure and he values depth up front, so adding Odighizuwa makes sense from a value and need standpoint. </p>",,,,,,

He needs to improve his decision-making, and he played in a scheme that ran a lot of screens and quick-hitters that simplified his reads. However, he was also asked to go through full-field progressions on several throws, and he showed above-average vision on those plays. One area of concern is durability. He's had some problems staying healthy, and he's lean at this point.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Drew Brees is 36 years old -- time catches up with all players at some point. In addition, Luke McCown turns 34 this year, and it's unlikely that 2013 college free-agent signing Ryan Griffin is the long-term answer. Taking Grayson now allows him to get acclimated with Sean Payton's offense and learn from watching one of the best in the league in Brees.  </p>",4.75,,,,,

However, he needs to add polish as a route runner and while he flashes the ability to make the acrobatic catch, his hands are inconsistent on tape. Conley has an extremely high ceiling with the size and raw athleticism to develop into a quality vertical receiver outside the hashes if he can continue to hone his craft.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Even after signing Jeremy Maclin in free agency, wide receiver was still a big area of need for Kansas City, as they did not have a touchdown reception from a receiver in 2014.  Conley is an explosive athlete who provides a vertical threat to stretch the field and loosen up coverage underneath, and provides more room to run after the catch, which is pivotal in an Andy Reid system.  </p>",4.35,45.0,18.0,139.0,7.06,4.3

There's a lot to like about him on the field, particularly his outstanding instincts and recognition skills, which make up for his lack of ideal fluidity and speed. His best fit is in press-man or zone coverages, because he could be a liability in off-man. He's aggressive in run support.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> The Saints signed Brandon Browner to start opposite Keenan Lewis and Kyle Wilson to compete for the nickelback role, but Wilson signed a one-year deal and developmental 2014 second-round pick Stanley Jean-Baptiste doesn't appear ready to push for significant playing time. Williams adds depth and competition and has the potential to develop into a solid player.</p> ",4.57,40.0,12.0,132.0,7.08,4.28

But he has a high upside as a pass-rusher, with several pass-rush moves and good athleticism and closing burst.</p></p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> If they can stay out of trouble and stay healthy, Aldon Smith and Aaron Lynch could serve as formidable edge rushers for years to come, but the 49ers aren't committed to Smith beyond this year. Ahmad Brooks could also become a cap casualty if he doesn't restructure his contract over the next two seasons. Eli Harold is a good value at this point, he is a good fit at outside linebacker in new defensive coordinator Eric Mangini's base 3-4 scheme, and he has the skills to develop into a formidable edge rusher at that spot. </p>",4.6,35.0,,123.0,7.07,4.16

He's also got the frame and leaping ability to match up with bigger receivers competing for 50-50 balls, but he's not a ball hawk (two career interceptions). He also lacks ideal change-of-direction skills, so he needs to win with physicality to hold own in man working against most receivers. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Rashean Mathis re-signed for two years and is expected to start opposite Darius Slay, but he's 34 years old and Carter could be considered his heir. Carter is a good fit for this zone-heavy scheme, plus Nevin Lawson, Bill Bentley and Mohammed Seisay combined for only 89 snaps last year. Free-agent signing Josh Wilson adds depth, but he's not expected to push for substantial playing time. </p>",4.51,40.0,17.0,121.0,7.05,4.07

While he's tough to shed when he gets his hands inside and locks on, his initial hand placement is highly inconsistent both as a run-blocker and in pass protection. His inconsistencies adjusting to line stunts in pass protection and locating assignments as a run-blocker are also concerning, especially considering he was a four-year starter at Louisville. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Bills needed to add youth and depth on the interior.  Miller has a quality inline power base to drive and steer defenders off the ball when in position, which is exactly what offensive coordinator Greg Roman is looking for in his power-blocking scheme. This is a good pick by the Bills, as Miller also brings the toughness coach Rex Ryan wants in his ground-and-pound philosophy. </p>",5.33,27.0,29.0,104.0,8.2,4.75

He's a tweener who doesn't have ideal top-end speed for a 3-4 outside linebacker or size for a 4-3 defensive end prospect. He's a slightly better fit at 3-4 outside linebacker, where he has the upper-body strength and enough bulk to set the edge. While he's not going to win many battles with pure speed, he's got enough quickness, power and balance to make an impact rushing the passer.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> First-year head coach Todd Bowles is a defensive-minded guy, so it comes to no surprise that he continues to address the front seven. Outside linebackers Calvin Pace, Quinton Coples and Jason Babin combined for just 13.5 sacks in 2014, and the need to find more pass-rushing production is evident. Mauldin has upside as a pass-rusher and has the potential to upgrade New York's presence off the edge. </p>",4.85,32.0,23.0,112.0,7.47,4.58

He still has some developing to do with his technique and awareness, but he shows adequate mirror skills in man coverage to potentially add depth to a secondary. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After Shareece Wright departed via free agency, the need to add depth at cornerback behind Jason Verrett and Brandon Flowers was clear. Mager is an instinctive player with the versatility to play inside the slot and will have an immediate impact on special teams.  </p>",4.44,38.0,17.0,130.0,6.83,4.07
973,46950,Jordan Hicks,ILB,236,73.375,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> There's a lot to like about Hicks' instincts, motor and range on tape, plus he tested well at the combine and he has the potential to develop into an effective special-teams contributor. However, he's on the lighter side for an inside linebacker prospect and struggles to anchor when he gets caught in a phone booth. He's also an inconsistent tackler with just adequate stopping power. Finally, he has had some problems staying healthy in the past, and Texas' decision to suspend him before the Longhorns played in the 2012 Alamo Bowl raises concern about his off-the-field decision-making. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Eagles traded for Kiko Alonso this offseason, and he is expected to start opposite the talented Mychal Kendricks. DeMeco Ryans will provide excellent depth as well, so inside linebacker doesn't appear to be much of a need at first glance.  However, Kendricks, who has been the subject of trade rumors, is entering the final year of his rookie contract and Ryans, who turns 31 this year, is coming off a season-ending injury. Hicks is an excellent fit on the inside with the ability to push for a starting role early in his career in the Eagles' 3-4 scheme. </p>",,,,,,

He's just an average blocker, as he makes the most of the strength he has but can still get overpowered on occasion.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Offensive coordinator Hue Jackson utilizes a lot of two-tight end sets, and with Jermaine Gresham likely not returning, Kroft makes sense here. He is one of the more complete tight ends and a quality blocker, who can open up creases for RBs Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard. </p>",4.75,,17.0,,,

Still, he's an effective runner, and he is a highly productive pass-catcher out of the backfield. He has very good vision at the line of scrimmage and in the open field.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Arizona needed a big back to complement Andre Ellington, who landed on injured reserve with a sports hernia injury last year (only the Browns and Raiders averaged fewer yards after contact per rush than the Cardinals in 2014). While he doesn't have elite power for a bigger back, Johnson still picks up yards after contact thanks to his effort and size. </p>",4.5,41.5,25.0,127.0,6.82,4.27

He's a strong edge-setter against the run and plays with outstanding energy and toughness.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Everson Griffen had breakout year after signing an extension, and Tom Johnson re-signed for three years, but 32-year-old Brian Robison's sack production dipped last year, so adding a defensive end makes sense. Hunter is a good value at this point, and he has the potential to develop into a dangerous pass-rusher in time. </p>",4.57,,25.0,,,

While he needs to develop as a decision-maker, he flashes the ability to work through his progressions and has functional mobility within the pocket to buy time. He also has quality arm strength and can be accurate at all three levels when he's on balance and has room to throw. Mannion has similar traits to Tampa Bay QB Mike Glennon and could end up sticking in the league for 10 to 12 years as an adequate backup with a chance to develop into a starter.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Rams traded for Nick Foles this offseason, but he's in the last year of his contract, missed the final eight games of the 2014 season with a broken collarbone and didn't play nearly as well to start the season as he did in 2103. Backups Austin Davis and Case Keenum haven't shown they can be successful long-term starters, either.

He is very disruptive against the run and as a pass-rusher with his quickness and strength, and he can play multiple positions in multiple defensive fronts. But his motor is very up and down.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Ravens have stockpiled defensive linemen in recent years, as Davis is the 12th they've selected in the past six drafts. Davis provides depth left by the departure of Haloti Ngata and will bolster Baltimore's interior and help them continue to be stout against the run, as they ranked fourth in rush defense last season. </p>",5.07,33.0,,103.0,7.91,4.47

Humphries during the pre-draft process, but the team captain and three-year starter has prototypical height and weight with adequate arm length for a right tackle prospect. He gets into position and flashes the ability to move defenders off the ball as a run-blocker. He has some problems dealing with speed rushers, but he also flashes the ability to push speed rushers past the pocket and recover when he gives ground to speed-to-power initially in pass protection.   </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Dallas re-signed right offensive tackle Doug Free to a three-year deal, but he's 31 years old, missed five games last year and underwent ankle surgery following the season. While he's expected to be ready to go for the 2015 season, backup Jermey Parnell, who filled in well last year, left in free agency. The Cowboys' offensive line is the best in the league and a big reason for their success last year, so getting an insurance policy if Free gets hurt again makes sense.

Heuerman is an underrated athlete and has a chance to be a much better pro than college player. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After signing Owen Daniels and James Casey via free agency, the Broncos continued to add depth at the tight end position. Heuerman is an underrated athlete and should make an immediate impact as an inline blocker in the run game.

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Corey Redding and Ricky Jean-Francois departed in free agency and DT Arthur Jones has struggled to stay healthy, so there is a need to add bodies along the front line. Anderson fits the mold, as he has the length to line up at 5-technique and create disruption within defensive coordinator Greg Manusky's base 3-4 scheme. </p>",4.97,30.0,,111.0,7.2,4.19
982,46916,Ty Montgomery,WR,221,71.875,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> Montgomery is at his best when he has the ball in his hands regardless if that's after the catch, in the return game or on a carry thanks to his blend of vision, elusiveness and balance in space. His timed top-end speed is just average, and he's not an elite vertical threat who regularly takes the top off the coverage, but he flashes the ability to turn on the jets when he gets a seam as a ball carrier. The biggest area of concern is his hands. He drops passes he should catch and fights the ball too much despite the fact that he has a big hand span.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Receiver isn't a pressing need after re-signing Randall Cobb, but Green Bay makes a value pick here and gives Aaron Rodgers yet another weapon by taking Montgomery. In addition, Montgomery is a dangerous return man who should give the Packers' kickoff return unit a much-needed boost. </p>",4.55,40.5,,121.0,6.97,4.21

While he isn't a dynamic runner, Jones has quick feet, adequate lateral agility and flashes the versatility as a receiving threat to provide quality depth at the position. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Jones is a little bit of a reach here, but not by a lot and he fills a need for Washington. While Alfred Morris became the first Redskins player to rush for 1,000 in each of his first three seasons, his 4.1-yard average was lowest of career and he's entering a contract season.

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Browns continue to stockpile bodies along the front seven.  Cooper provides the quickness with enough size and versatility to fit within their hybrid front.

Grissom will have limitations if asked to consistently play in space as a 3-4 OLB. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Patriots covet versatility on defense and Grissom fits the bill. He has experience playing with his hand in the dirt and in a two-point stance, which plays well into defensive coordinator Mattt Patricia's hands. Grissom has a chance to make an impact as an edge defender, where he is stout against the run and brings upside as a pass-rusher. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After selecting Marcus Peters in the first round, the Chiefs continue to build depth in the back end.

His short-area quickness, power and low center of gravity make him tough to handle one-on-one. He has the heavy hands, burst and motor to develop into an effective interior pass-rusher. He's also versatile enough to play 4-3 defensive tackle or 3-4 defensive end.

However, McDonald fits as press cornerback, where he can use his length to disrupt receivers at the line of scrimmage and has the size to match up with bigger receivers in contested situations.",4.47,,,,,
1127,47040,Laurence Gibson,OT,305,77.75,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> Gibson is a work in progress whose footwork, hand placement and pad level all need to get better if he is to play a substantial role in the NFL. On the other hand, there's no questioning his potential, as he has everything teams are looking for in a left tackle prospect, in terms of natural ability. He has a quick first step, changes directions well, has excellent arm length and has bulked up to 312 pounds.  ",5.04,33.5,24.0,113.0,7.72,4.56
1128,47016,Trent Brown,OG,355,80.5,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> Brown, at 6-foot-8 ½ and 355 pounds, is massive. He engulfs defensive tackles and flashes the ability to drive them off the ball in the run game, plus his rare arm length and wide frame make it tough to get around him in pass protection. The problem is he started just 11 games over the past two seasons, and he didn't play football until his junior year of high school. He lunges and ends up on the ground too much at this point. In addition, his weight is a blessing and a curse. His ability to control it and stay in shape will be crucial to his success.  ",,,,,,
1129,46922,Tre McBride,WR,210,72.25,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> At 6 feet tall and 210 pounds, McBride is a smooth athlete who transitions well getting out of the stem to create separation. He also has the speed to threaten the vertical seams. His best attribute is his ball skills, as he consistently catches the ball away from his frame and flashes excellent body control.

1130,47286,Geoff Swaim,TE,252,76.375,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> Swaim is a developmental prospect who has the frame, length, leaping ability and top-end speed to develop into a productive receiver, but he's a JUCO transfer who caught a total of 13 passes in his two seasons at Texas. He'll also have to fill out that frame to develop into an in-line blocker at the NFL level. The good news is he can contribute on special teams as he develops as a tight end.",,,,,,
1131,47035,Darryl Roberts,CB,187,71.0,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> Roberts needs some fine-tuning with his technique and awareness, but he has a lot of raw athleticism. Roberts possesses quick feet, fluidity and an explosive closing burst that provide him with a lot of developmental upside. ",,,,,,
1132,47481,Akeem King,S,215,73.5,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p><strong>What he brings:</strong> King didn't crack the starting lineup until his senior year, plus he's got smaller hands, and he failed to record an interception. But he's got some upside, thanks to his size and top-end speed. He can also contribute on special teams.",,,,,,

In his final two seasons completed 63.8 percent of his throws with 78 TDs compared to 20 INTs (3.9-1 ratio). Goff has first-round physical tools, as well as high-level football intelligence and work ethic, which is why he might be the top QB selected in 2016. But in order to sustain success in the NFL, Goff must improve his consistency with lower-body mechanics (which will lead to better ball placement) and continue to add bulk his frame. -April 1, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Goff is an experienced three-year starter who is one of the most natural passers in this class. He has excellent pocket presence and feels pressure naturally to buy time while going through progressions. Goff shows accuracy and touch with the ability to deliver from an uneven platform. He has added weight and that eases concerns about his durability. He might need time adjusting to an NFL playbook coming from a wide-open system. He is one of the top two quarterbacks in this class and has the tools and acumen to develop into an above-average starter. <br>

<b>How he fits:</b> Goff is more NFL-ready than Carson Wentz with more starts and experience against a higher level of competition, which likely factored into the Rams' decision.  Coming from Cal's ""Bear Raid"" spread system, Goff will need time adapting and learning an NFL playbook. The good news for Goff is that the Rams have an excellent defense and a Pro Bowl RB in Todd Gurley they can lean on while Goff develops in the early going. -- Kevin Weidl

In 2015, he broke his right wrist in Game 7 and was sidelined for eight games (12 weeks) before returning for the FCS National Championship, in which he led the Bison to its fifth-straight title (37-10 over Jacksonville State). Wentz only started 23 games at the FCS level, but he earned a 20-3 record. There's no questioning his football intelligence, maturity and leadership skills. Wentz projects as a first-round pick and could be the first QB selected in 2016. --February 1, 2016. <b>What he brings:</b> One of the top two quarterbacks in this class, Wentz is blessed with a strong combination of size and athleticism. He has very good arm strength to make all the necessary throws. He displays quality accuracy at all three levels. There are some concerns about his lack of experience and making the jump from the FCS level. However, Wentz has the tools, football intelligence, maturity and leadership skills to develop into a quality starting QB in the NFL. 
<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Wentz comes with an excellent physical skill set and overall makeup, but he has just 23 career starts and will be making a significant jump coming from the FCS level to the NFL. Similar to Goff, Wentz goes to an ideal situation -- assuming the Sam Bradford situation works itself out -- where he can have the luxury of being developed the proper way by sitting and learning from head coach Doug Peterson, who has been an excellent mentor at the position. -- Kevin Weidl",4.77,30.5,,118.0,6.86,4.15

His sack production dipped in 2015 (8.5 sacks versus 13.5 in '14), while being double-or-triple teamed nearly every snap. But he finished his 41-game career with 50.5 TFLs, 26 sacks and 5 FFs, while notching a Power-5 best 101 total pressures the last two seasons. Bosa lacks elite speed off the edge (verified by 4.86 40 at Combine) but the rest of his physical traits range from good to elite, and he shows the relentlessness and instincts shared by most top-level NFL pass rushers. -April 5, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> He's the best edge defender and arguably one of the top two prospects in this class. Bosa displays heavy and active hands and possesses excellent core strength, along with the instincts to find the ball and finish plays as a run stopper. While he doesn't have elite quickness or bend, he is a relentless pass rusher who brings strong speed-to-power ability and the versatility to kick inside and cause disruption. He brings a great motor and approach to the game and will instantly upgrade a defensive front. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> We felt Bosa's best fit was as a DE in a base 4-3 scheme, but he has the size, power and versatility to line up in multiple spots along their 3-4 scheme.  His best scenario may be to continue to try and bulk to line up at the 5-technique where he can help improve a 27th-ranked rush defense and provide some pass rush with his power and hands. -- Kevin Weidl",4.86,32.0,24.0,120.0,6.89,4.21

In addition to his well-rounded skills in the run game, Elliott shows natural pass-catching ability, and he brings elite toughness to the field as a blocker. Elliott is the top running back prospect in the 2016 class and he projects as a top-15 pick. --March 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Elliott is a highly competitive runner with an excellent combination of agility, power and top-end speed for a bigger back. He also shows natural pass-catching ability, and he brings elite toughness to the field as a blocker. Elliott is the best running back in the class, and while he's not as dynamic of a runner as Adrian Peterson or Todd Gurley, his well-rounded skill set makes him the rare RB prospect who's actually worth a first-round pick. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> This may not appear to be a pressing need considering the Cowboys finished fifth in yards per rush last year, but Elliott has the vision, power and speed to immediately leapfrog Darren McFadden and Alfred Morris to take over as the primary ball carrier. He should also become quarterback Tony Romo's best friend as he catches the ball well and he's an effective pass-blocker. -- Steve Muench

Ramsey has exceptional length and rare versatility line up any where in the secondary. Biggest knock right now is his lack of elite ball skills. Ramsey also comes with outstanding makeup. Raised in a supportive and disciplined 2-parent home. Father Lamont is a fire fighter in Nashville. Highly competitive individual that loves the game and with excellent leadership and preparation habits. Team captain. Ramsey is a top-5 player in this class with All-Pro potential. April 3, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> An explosive athlete with the rare versatility to line up in multiple spots in the secondary, Ramsey has exceptionally long arms and the most natural movement skills of any defensive back in this class. He also plays with a physical edge in run support. Minor concerns include inconsistent ball skills and the fact that he does not always finish when provided the opportunity. Still, whether he lines up at cornerback or safety, he's the top defensive back in this class and will serve as an instant upgrade in the secondary. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> Ramsey is an ideal fit within Jacksonville's press-zone scheme, which should enable them to keep at cornerback if they wish. He also brings excellent versatility to provide defensive coordinator Todd Walsh a weapon to be a matchup in multiple rolls in the back end. Ramsey, along with the free-agent signing of Prince Amukamara, should instantly help improve the Jaguars' pass defense, which was 29th in the NFL last season. -- Kevin Weidl

He's an outstanding pass blocker with a prototypical frame and he projects best at left tackle where has the ability to compete for a starting role as a rookie. That said, it's worth noting that he's a versatile player who could play on the right side as he played right tackle in 2013 before moving to left tackle for his last two seasons at Notre Dame. --April 5, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> A left tackle prospect with three years of starting experience and quality awareness, Stanley excels in pass protection with natural feet, good agility and the length to keep edge rushers at bay. At this point, he's more of a positional run-blocker who will need to continue to get stronger and play with more aggression in this area. The second-best offensive tackle in this class, Stanley should be ready to step into a starting role from day one. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b>  We had Ole Miss offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil ranked ahead of Stanley, but this is an excellent pick nonetheless. The Ravens need an upgrade at left offensive tackle, where Eugene Monroe has missed 15 games over the past two seasons. Stanley isn't an elite run-blocker but he's effective enough to help improve a ground game that finished 26th in the league last year, and he's an outstanding pass-blocker. -- Steve Muench",5.2,28.5,,,8.03,4.9

Buckner had just 7.5 sacks during his first three seasons but he racked up 10.5 sacks in 2016. He played in all 54 games during his four-year career and totaled 30 TFLs as a fulltime starter the last two (2014-15). Buckner has been durable and productive, and his versatility is appealing for teams that like to be multiple on defense. Buckner is a top-10 prospect. -March 22, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Buckner is a top-five prospect with outstanding measurables, raw power and above-average athleticism. He's a long-levered run defender who has the ability to create penetration and hold the point of attack. He needs some refining as a pass rusher and has to learn to play with lower pad level, but Buckner has the quickness, heavy hands and speed-to-power capability to add value getting after the QB. The bottom line? He is a durable and productive defender, whose versatility will allow him to play multiple spots along the D-line. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> The 49ers are still looking to replenish the talent along the front seven and Buckner fits the mold.  He needs to continue to get stronger but he has the ideal frame to fit as 5-technique. Buckner will instantly be an upgrade for their 29th-ranked rush defense and provides upside as a pass-rusher, if he gets the proper coaching.  -- Kevin Weidl

Started 38 out of 39 career games over the past 3 seasons. He has ideal length (35-inch arms), who is a powerful run blocker that plays with a nasty disposition to quickly compete for a starting spot at right tackle. He tested extremely well at the combine including a 5.00 in the 40-yard dash while his jump and agility testing were all above-average as well. Conklin is the third best offensive tackle in the 2016 class who should come off board within the top-20 picks of the first round. --April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Conklin is a former walk-on who plays with a chip on his shoulder. A powerful run-blocker, he has good inline power and is constantly working to finish blocks. He is not an elite athlete, but he has ideal length and enough athleticism to keep blockers at bay when his technique is sound. Conklin played left tackle in college, but he projects as a right tackle in the NFL. He has the physicality and toughness that is coveted at the position. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b>  Most felt that Titans first-year general manager Jon Robinson would target an offensive tackle had he not traded out of the first pick, considering Tennessee surrendered a league-high 54 sacks last year. Now he trades back into the top 10 to get one of the top three tackles in this draft. We projected Conklin as a right tackle but he tested better than expected and he could stay at left tackle, which would allow Taylor Lewan to shift over to the right side.  -- Steve Muench

His sack production dropped in 2015 (4.5 sacks) but Floyd spent far more time working as an off the ball LB where he showcased his ability to play in space. He needs to continue to improve his strength and consistency versus the run, but Floyd has a unique skill set with explosive athleticism (39.5 VJ, 10-7 BJ). Unofficial 4.60 forty at combine (pulled hamstring on 1st run) and did not fully participate at pro day due to an illness. Floyd projects as a mid 1st round selection. April 7, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Floyd is arguably the most versatile edge defender in this class who has an outstanding combination of length and athleticism. He displays natural instincts as a pass-rusher with quality first-step quickness and flexibility to gain the edge while also flashing an effective inside changeup move. Though his sack production dipped in 2015, he played as more of an off linebacker where he showcased his range as a space player in coverage. He will bring immediate help on third downs and should quickly push for a starting job. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> After helping find help at the inside linebacker position by signing Jerrell Freeman and Danny Trevathan in free agency, the Bears add the most versatile edge rusher in this class for defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's 3-4 defense.

Apple has an outstanding size-speed combination; his 4.40 40-yard dash is the 4th-fastest by a DB 6-1 or taller at the NFL Combine since 2006. While he's strong in run support, Apple will get pushed around at times by bigger WRs when in coverage and his ball skills are a work in progress. If utilized and coached properly, Apple can develop into a good starter in the NFL. He grades out as an early 2nd round prospect that could be drafted in Round 1 due to positional value. -April 5, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Apple's 4.40 40-yard dash is the fourth-fastest by a defensive back 6-foot1 or taller at the NFL scouting combine since 2006. He's not only an athlete, though. He does an above-average job of reading routes in man coverage and reading quarterbacks' eyes in zone coverage on tape. He has to get stronger and improve his ability to match up with bigger receivers, but he has the frame to bulk up and develop into an excellent press corner. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b>  The Giants didn't have a pressing need at corner considering they signed Janoris Jenkins in free agency and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie went to the Pro Bowl last year. Apple is a reach this early, but he has the frame, top-end speed and instincts to develop into an effective starter in defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo's scheme and he should provide quality depth early on. -- Steve Muench",4.4,,13.0,,,

(His father Vernon II is currently the LB coach for Arkansas.) He has outstanding instincts and possesses the most natural movement skills in the this year's CB class. He is undersized and can be susceptible to an occasional big play down the field. But he has the aggressiveness and confidence to overcome his lack of ideal measureables, which will allow him to develop into a quality starting CB on the outside. He projects as an early first round selection. --March 23, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Hargreaves is an undersized cornerback who is one of the most instinctive and natural man coverage cornerbacks in this class. He shows smooth and balanced movement skills to mirror receivers, and he displays excellent anticipation and ball awareness. On the flip side, he lacks ideal measurables and doesn't have elite top-end speed, which brings up some concerns about his downfield range against elite receivers at the next level. Overall, he has the football intelligence, the movement skills and the willingness in run support to develop into a quality starting cornerback outside the hashes or become one of the better nickelbacks in the NFL. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> First-year defensive coordinator Mike Smith's heavy zone scheme is a good fit for Hargreaves. This scheme will allow him to minimize the downfield range concerns and allow him to line up outside the hashes, while also letting him maximize his playmaking anticipation and ball skills to manufacture turnovers.

He played multiple spots along Louisville's front and can potentially do the same in the NFL, although we believe his best fit is as a 4-3 nose tackle.

In 2015, he was suspended by the NCAA for seven games due to impermissible benefits and failing to be forthcoming with investigators. If comfortable with his durability and character issues, Tunsil is the clear-cut top offensive lineman in this draft. He has perennial Pro Bowl potential. --March 25, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Born to protect the quarterback, Tunsil is blessed with an outstanding combination of natural athleticism and length. He also has natural flexibility in his lower half to sink and anchor against power moves, displaying quality awareness in pass protection. Durability is a bit of concern, as Tunsil missed time because of injury in his first two seasons at Ole Miss. While he isn't a road-grading run-blocker, he has enough inline power and agility to cover up defenders and sustain blocks. One of the elite prospects in this class, Tunsil has the makings of a franchise left tackle for the next decade. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> This appears to be more as a value pick as it wasn't as big a need for Miami after signing Jermon Bushrod in free agency. However, left tackle Branden Albert turns 32 and Tunsil has the talent to quickly develop into a franchise left tackle if he is able to maintain his focus on and off the field.

He's rangy, he showed much improved diagnostic skills in coverage last season and he's a ball hawk. He's also an outstanding run defender with above average stopping power even though he doesn't have great size. Finally, he was a two-time team captain at West Virginia. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b>  The Raiders signed Reggie Nelson to help replace Charles Woodson but they need a safety capable of starting opposite him, as a torn MCL limited Nate Allen to five games in 2015. Joseph is the top safety on our board so he's a good value in addition to filling a need. The Raiders finished 13th in interceptions last year and Joseph has the potential to be a playmaker.  -- Steve Muench",4.57,,,,,

He has average size and outstanding speed (verified by 4.38 at Pro Day), but he's a raw route runner with a concerning career drop percentage (6.6%). In 2015, Coleman caught 74 passes for 1,363 yards (18.4) and 20 TDs. He failed to deliver vs. top competition (9-136-0 vs. OKL, OKLST, and TCU) but Coleman was playing with a sports hernia injury, which required surgery in December and kept him out of the bowl game (UNC). We gave Coleman an early 2nd-round grade but he's a likely first-round pick. -April 4, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Coleman needs to make strides as a route runner, and his 2015 drop percentage (6.6 percent) is reason for concern, but he has the potential to get better in those areas. He does have something you can't coach up, and that's speed. He's fast enough to run past corners who don't give him a healthy cushion, and he has the burst to pull away from pursuit when he gets a crease after the catch. -- Steve Muench
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> After losing Travis Benjamin to free agency and with the uncertainty of Josh Gordon's future, the Browns needed to add a spark on the perimeter. Coleman is the most explosive receiver in this class who has the speed to stretch the field and ability to create with the ball in his hands.  Cleveland has done a nice job of maneuvering back to acquire picks while finding the receiver it targeted with a quality value. -- Kevin Weidl",4.42,40.5,17.0,129.0,,

He has experience at both tackle positions but projects best at right tackle in the NFL (due to average movement skills and lack of ideal arm length -- 33 3/4 inches). Decker doesn't have a lot of flash in his game, but he's one of the steadier offensive linemen that you'll study on tape. He's a technician with the right makeup to become a very solid starter for a decade in the NFL. --March 8, 2016. <b>What he brings:</b> Decker is an experienced three-year starter who has played at both tackle positions. He doesn't have elite athleticism, and combined with his lack of length he projects as a right tackle at the next level.

He's a technician with the right makeup to become a very solid starter for a decade in the NFL. -- Kevin Weidl

<b> How he fits:</b>  This pick makes sense from a value and need standpoint. The Lions need to improve a ground game that finished dead last in rushing yards per game last year and address the right tackle position. While he's just an average pass-blocker and the bulk of his experience is at left tackle, Decker is a powerful run-blocker with some experience lining up on the right. -- Steve Muench

He has adequate range, provides a physical presence and is an effective blitzer. Jumps at combine (VJ: 38"", BJ 11'0"") correlate with the explosive hits on tape. The two year starter elected to declare after his true junior season and has the potential to quickly develop into a starter and should come off the board within the top 75 picks for the 2016 draft. -- April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Neal is an outstanding run defender with above average stopping power and the potential to quickly develop into a starter. While his timed top-end speed (4.63 in the 40-yard dash) is slightly below average, he covers more ground than safeties who run similar times. He has the ability to diagnose quickly, meaning he gets an early break on the ball. -- Steve Muench
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> William Moore departed in free agency, leaving a void at strong safety that will be filled by Neal.  He brings a physical edge that defensive coordinator Richard Smith will welcome and need to infuse within the defense.

He's also got the size to play offensive guard. --April 10, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Kelly has one of the highest floors in this class and that's why he's the top center on our board. While he's not an overpowering run-blocker, he gets into position and sustains both as a run-blocker and in pass protection. He also tested well in key categories for centers at the combine -- running a 5.03 40-yard dash, recording a 4.59 short shuttle and recording an 8-foot-7 broad jump. He's a team captain and three-year starter who makes sound line calls and has the football IQ to step in as a Day 1 starter. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b>  Right tackle is arguably a greater need for Indianapolis but the value isn't there with Decker coming off the board two picks earlier, and center is still a pressing need. The Colts fill that need by getting the top center on the board in Kelly who has one of the highest floors in this class and projects as an immediate starter.

He has a great looking frame, a strong football-character makeup and he was the power cord for Clemson's defense in 2015. He leaves it all on the field. While he has some athletic limitations, Lawson is an excellent run defender and has a good combination of quickness, power and relentlessness as a pass rusher. Lawson projects as a top-20 pick in the 2016 draft. --March 28, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Lawson has a great looking frame, a strong football-character makeup and plays with infectious energy. He is an excellent run defender with heavy hands and quality upper-body power. While he has some athletic limitations, he possesses a strong combination of quickness, power and relentlessness as a pass-rusher. He will provide an immediate physical edge to a front seven and should quickly develop into an impact edge defender.

<b> How he fits:</b> Lawson adds some youth on the edge and helps ease the loss of Mario Williams' departure in free agency. He also plays with a relentless motor and physical edge that head coach Rex Ryan covets on defense.

He also notched 7.5 sacks, two interceptions and a forced fumble. In 2015, Lee's production dipped, but he still finished with 66-11-4.5. The former high school quarterback and cornerback is an undersized weak-side linebacker who needs refinement, but he's aggressive and tough, and he's blessed with an elite combination of speed and athleticism (as confirmed by his sensational performance at the NFL combine). --March 4, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> One of the better space linebackers in this class, Lee is a rangy run defender who shows fast eyes and quality recognition skills. His best value as a prospect comes on third down, during which he has the athleticism to matchup in zone or man coverage. He is an underrated blitzer. While he is undersized and will never be a strong point-of-attack defender, Lee is an ideal fit for today's game and should quickly develop into an impactful weak-side linebacker. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b>  Lee is an excellent value at this point. Though he doesn't appear to be an ideal fit for the Jets' scheme, he has the potential to develop into an effective weakside inside linebacker in New York's base 3-4 scheme and the Jets have a need there with Demario Davis signing with the Browns this offseason.

He's a dangerous vertical threat who excels at taking the top off the coverage and he's a dangerous after the catch. His lean frame and inconsistent hands are both reasons for concern but it would be a surprise if team didn't target this play maker late in the first or early in the second. March, 11 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Averaging more than 20 yards per catch in 2015, he has elite top-end speed and is the top vertical receiving threat. He also shows an adequate feel as a route runner and is an underrated runner after the catch. His best value will come in a heavy vertical passing game with a strong-armed quarterback. However, though he can deliver a big play down the field at any point, teams must also be ready for some drops as he does not appear to be a natural-hands catcher and has the highest drop percentage of any receiver in this class (8.6 percent). <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> After signing QB Brock Osweiler in free agency, the Texans needed to infuse speed at receiver to complement his big arm. Fuller fits the bill here as he ran the fastest 40-yard dash at the combine and is the top vertical threat in this class.  He should have plenty of one-on-one opportunities to manufacture big plays due to the attention WR Deandre Hopkins will garner lining up on the opposite side.  -- Kevin Weidl",4.32,33.5,10.0,126.0,6.93,4.27

He has turned himself into one of the most prolific receivers in school history despite missing three games with a wrist injury last year and he finished second in the FBS in receiving yards per game last year. While he doesn't have elite top-end speed and he needs to get stronger he's a natural pass catcher with the ball skills, frame and enough top-end speed to quickly develop into an effective No.2 receiver. April 2, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> The best receiver in this class tracking and playing the ball in the air, Doctson has the size, leaping skills and focus to present a one-on-one matchup problem down the field outside the hashes. He needs to add some polish and comes with some minor durability concerns, but he has enough speed and agility to develop and should quickly become a quarterback's best friend in the red zone. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b>  This may not seem like a need for Washington, but Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson are both entering contract years with high cap numbers, plus Jackson missed seven games with injuries last year. In addition, Doctson is an excellent value at this point and he should quickly earn the trust of quarterback Kirk Cousins with his ability to come down with 50-50 balls downfield.

Without him, the Rebels averaged just 11.3 points in their three remaining games vs. FBS teams. Treadwell put durability worries to rest with a bounce-back season in 2015 (82-1,153-11). Treadwell lacks vertical speed but is a complete player otherwise. Grades out as a late first-round prospect. --March 25, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Treadwell is a highly competitive and physical receiver who thrives in contested situations. He isn't a burner, but he is a quality route runner who has the size, strength and length to create late separation. Treadwell is a strong and balanced runner after the catch and takes a lot of pride as a run-blocker. Though he might never be an elite No. 1 receiver, he's arguably the top at this position who will instantly upgrade a receiving corps. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> The Vikings found great value with their 2015 fifth-round selection of WR Stefon Diggs and continue to try to add weapons on the perimeter. Treadwell is the strong and physical receiver who has the ability to win in the contested situations Minnesota has been missing outside the hashes and in the red zone.

He is a long and athletic CB who tested well at the combine and has very good down field range to hold up on an island. He's is also coachable, hardworking and hungry, but he's a former non-qualifier who needs extra time/reps to process new information which is slightly concerning. Jackson has a chance to be one of the top 5 CBs selected and will likely be off the board within the top-40 picks. April 2, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> There has been a lot of buzz building around Jackson leading up to the draft. He has excellent top-end speed and the fluidity to turn and run with NFL receivers. Although Jackson doesn't show elite fluidity in space, he has above-average balance and foot speed for a 6-foot-1, 193-pound cornerback. Finally, he has above-average ball skills, and he's a threat to score when he does come down with the ball. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b>  In a perfect world the Bengals would have gotten a receiver here and filed a more pressing need, but the value wasn't there with the top four WRs already off the board. Jackson is a good value here and he has the length as well as the speed to excel in defensive coordinator Paul Guenther's unit.

He needs to get stronger, not only in coverage but also supporting the edge as a run defender.

St. tapes. But not so much versus FLA and ARK.

He is a versatile defender who flashes as quick and as explosive a first step as any defensive tackle in this class to create penetration up the field. However, while he is very disruptive on tape, he hasn't been productive and can show better instincts to finish.

When Ogbah is on, he can be an impact pass-rusher while also providing quality point-of-attack skills defending the run.

1285,50257,Kevin Dodd,DE,277,77.0,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dodd lacks ideal experience as 2015 was his first season as a full-time starter. The good news is that he showed consistent improvement as he gained experience and was playing at a very high level towards the end of the year including recording 13.5 TFLs and 7.5 sacks over his final five games. On the flip side, he did not test out well. 4.86 forty-yard dash and 30.5-inch VJ are near the red flag threshold for predicting success at the position. There are also some minor concerns from teams about his passion for the game. Dodd projects as a top-50 pick but comes with risk. April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Dodd is coming off a breakout season in which he had 62 tackles, 23.5 tackles for loss and 12 sacks. He's at his best rushing the passer, showing good bend around the edge. He flashes an effective change-of-pace inside move. Though he's not as effective defending the run, he has the frame and size to set the edge. On the downside, Dodd didn't test as well as expected at the combine, and his lack of production heading into his senior season raises a red flag. He has also had problems staying healthy. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> With Derrick Morgan coming off a season-ending shoulder injury and Deiontrez Mount coming of a torn ACL, the Titans needed to add competition and depth at outside linebacker. The 33rd-ranked player on our board, Dodd is a good value and he's athletic enough to line up at outside linebacker in Titans defensive coordinator Dick Lebeau base 3-4 looks. -- Steve Muench

He is a rare talent with the ability to impact the game on every snap. He's a sideline-to-sideline run defender, he' has excellent cover skills, and he's a far more disruptive pass rusher than the numbers suggest. Smith would have been a top-five pick had it not been for the left knee injury (torn ACL and MCL) suffered in this year's Fiesta Bowl (Ohio State). Where he lands on draft weekend now has everything to do with his medical report. -April 1, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Smith is arguably the top prospect in this draft class if he were healthy, however a major knee injury in the final game of his college career brings some uncertainty about his future in the pros. On tape, he has fast eyes and excellent ball reaction to go along with outstanding range, and he flashes explosive power as a tackler. He also brings strong value on third downs with the athleticism to hold up in coverage, and he is an underrated blitzer.  The recovery of his knee injury will determine his success at the next level, however he could end up being the steal of the draft if he is able to return to the caliber player we studied on tape. <br>

<b>How he fits:</b> This pick is an investment for the future pick, as Smith would have been the No. 1 player on our board if it wasn't for his knee injury.  Smith is an exceptional talent and has the ability to affect the game in every phase. Assuming Dallas felt good about his medical projection, the Cowboys have a chance to find a difference-making starter if he is able to return to his old form within a year or two's time. -- Kevin Weidl",4.67,,,,,

He did not elect to workout at the combine but ran well at his pro day clocking in the 4.66 range. Henry has a natural feel as a route runner and has extremely reliable hands (Compares very favorably to Dennis Pitta coming out of BYU in 2010). However, while he give quality effort he must continue to get stronger as an inline blocker. He is the top TE in the class and likely a top-50 selection. April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> The top tight end on our board, Henry is an above-average route runner who knows how to get open, catches the ball well and produces after the catch. He's also fast enough to get down the seam and make defenses pay for biting on play-action. While he's not a powerful blocker, he is an effective positional blocker with the frame to get better. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> Antonio Gates continues to produce, but he turns 36 in June and age catches up with everyone eventually. In addition, Ladarius Green signed with Pittsburgh and free-agent signing Jeff Cumberland is more of a role player than a potential replacement.

He underwent surgery in late September and was limited during the pre-draft process (no 40 or shuttles but posted a 40-inch vertical jump and 10-4 broad at UCLA's Pro Day). Multiple teams have told us his medical is a non-factor in his evaluation. Jack (178 tackles and 4 INTs in 29 career games) is a versatile, highly athletic WLB with elite range versus the run and cover skills in the pass game. Jack fits today's pass-heavy NFL perfectly; he's one of the best-10 prospects in this class. -April 2, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Arguably one of the most athletic prospects in this class, Jack is a perfect fit for today's NFL. He has sideline-to-sideline range and flashes explosive power. In addition, he is the top coverage linebacker in the class. Jack comes with some durability concerns after a season-ending torn meniscus this past fall, but his medical reports are positive. He is a top-10 prospect in this class who will add playmaking ability to a front seven. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> Jack is a top-five talent who fell out of the first round due to long-term durability concerns with his knee.  However, reports came out today that he would not need microfracture surgery and clearly Jacksonville felt good about his medical.  Jack has rare athleticism and explosiveness for his size to make an impact as a run defender, in coverage and as a blitzer.  With this pick the Jaguars have instantly upgraded their defense with the two most versatile defenders in this class (they took CB/DS Jalen Ramsey in the first round). -- Kevin Weidl",4.56,,19.0,,,

The former high school basketball standout is a versatile defensive lineman with an excellent combination of length, strength and athleticism for his frame. Jones has made big strides with his technique but is still a bit raw. If he remains focussed on mastering his craft, Jones can develop into a highly disruptive inside presence. Jones grades out as a Round 2 prospect. -April 11, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> An outstanding run-stopper, Jones has the long arms to press blockers off his frame and the quick hands to shed blocks with relative ease. He's also a powerful and sure tackle for the position. There aren't many defensive linemen who move as well as he does either, and there's a lot to like about his upside.

He has an intriguing skill set due to his size and fluidity that fits best in a heavy press-man or press-zone scheme (Shorter arms 31 1/4-inch). There are some slight concerns about giving up late separation down the field (Bowl Game vs UNC) and can become more consistent vs run. Improved 40-time from 4.56 to 4.43 at pro day. Howard projects as a day 2 CB who can develop into a quality starter. -- April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Howard (6-foot, 201) has the potential to develop into a quality starter in press-man and press-zone heavy schemes. He has intercepted nine passes during the past two seasons, and he should continue to take advantage of the chances he gets to make a play. Howard ran well at his pro day, but his 4.58 40-yard dash at the scouting combine was underwhelming. Also, there are light concerns about Howard giving up late separation. Finally, there's room for improvement when it comes to stopping the run. -- Steve Muench
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> Miami traded for Byron Maxwell to help replace the void left by Brent Grimes, who left for free agency. However, the Dolphins still have a void to fill on the opposite side.

Spence was dismissed from Ohio State in 2013 (multiple failed drug tests) and sat out 2014 before transferring to EKU. He had a highly productive year (11.5 sacks, 22.5 TFLs) and played well vs top competition (NC State, Kentucky) including at the Senior Bowl. Spence has taken steps to repair his reputation, however while his talent warrants a late 1st round grade he ultimately may end up falling the into day two range. April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Spence is arguably the most natural edge rusher of this class and an ideal fit as a 3-4 outside linebacker. He's not an elite athlete like Von Miller or Khalil Mack, but he has above-average initial quickness, quality bend and is an efficient hand fighter. Spence needs to continue to develop his instincts as a run defender but he shows the ability to stack the edge when playing with quality leverage. He is one of the bigger high-risk/high-reward prospects due to off-field red flags -- he was dismissed from Ohio State for Ecstasy use. -- Kevin Weidl<br>

<b> How he fits:</b> Tampa Bay needs to bolster a pass defense that finished dead last in opponent completion percentage (70.0), 31st in opponent passer rating (102.0) and tied for 25th in touchdown passes allowed last year.

He also returned 29 punts for a modest 7.3-yard average. Shepard lacks ideal size but he's slightly bigger than Tyler Lockett (Seahawks standout rookie and 2015 3rd-round pick). Lockett was slightly faster, ran faster shuttles and was more explosive in the return game, but Shepard is more polished as a slot-WR, has better vertical leap and slightly better ball skills. Shepard grades out as mid-Day 2 prospect. -April 2, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Shepard is an undersized and competitive player who projects as a slot receiver at the next level. He displays a nice feel for routes when setting up defenders, and he has above-average separation quickness getting out of his breaks. Shepard is fearless working the middle of the field and shows quality focus in traffic. He isn't a home-run threat after the catch, but he is an instinctive and elusive runner with the ability to move the chains. He should upgrade a perimeter with the chance to develop into a quality No. 3 receiver. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> The Giants look to fill the void left by Rueben Randle via free agency.

He started all 29 during his final two (2013-14) and combined for 195 total tackles, 17 TFL, 4 sacks, 10 PBUs and 3 FFs. He has a pro's approach, teammates and coaches respect him tremendously, and he was the tone-setter on Alabama's defense. Ragland has been durable but took a beating (shoulder, head). He has some coverage limitations and his key/diagnose are solid but not great. Otherwise, he's a complete football player with the size, speed, power and toughness to develop into a good starter at SILB in a 3-4 scheme or MIKE in a 4-3. -April 1, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> The top run-stopping linebacker in this class, Ragland brings size, excellent point-of-attack skills and a strong understanding of geometry with pursuit angles to provide him with sideline-to-sideline range. He also brings a physical element to his game and is an impactful knock-back tackler. While he has some athletic limitations, he has better third-down value than people think, including an underrated pass-rushing presence. He also brings outstanding football character and is one of the more NFL-ready prospects who could step in on day one as a starter. -- Kevin Weidl

<b> How he fits:</b> The 18th-best player on our board and the best player available, Ragland is an excellent value at this point in Round 2. He represents an immediate upgrade over inside linebacker Preston Brown, who struggled last year, and Ragland is a powerful run-stopper who should help improve Buffalo's run defense, which finished 16th in rushing yards allowed per game in 2015.

He has some work to do with his hand-to-hand combat and with his ball recognition skills, but Correa is a dynamic athlete with the versatility to rush the QB and hold up in coverage in the passing game, as well as set the edge and make plays in pursuit versus the run. Correa projects as an early-Day 2 pick. -April 10, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> A dynamic linebacker, Correa's greatest strength might be his ability to get after the quarterback as he has the burst, bend and closing speed to regularly threaten off the edge. He's also a sideline-to-sideline run defender, capable of matching up with tight ends in man coverage and rangy in zone coverage. The two areas he needs the most work include improving his diagnostic skills against the run and getting off blocks quicker. -- Steve Muench

He has the hands and enough quickness to disrupt plays in the backfield - 15 tackles-for loss last year -in addition to the size and strength to anchor and two gap. Though he doesn't project as a high-volume sack producer at the next level he does have some value as an interior pass rusher who forces quarterbacks off their spots. He projects as an early Day 2 pick. April 11, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> The 6-foot-4, 315-pound defensive tackle is a productive interior defensive lineman who finished last year with 15 tackles for loss and six sacks. Johnson is at his best defending the run. He has shown the ability to shoot gaps and disrupt plays in the backfield, as well as the ability to anchor and control blockers. Johnson doesn't project as a high volume pass-rusher, but he flashes the ability to push the pocket and move quarterbacks off the spot. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> This comes as a surprise for a couple of reasons. Jarran Reed and A'Shawn Robinson, both from Alabama, are available and better values at this point. In addition, the Titans re-signed Al Woods to a three-year deal, but Woods has started only 10 games over the past two years.

Ward also has shown toughness playing through pain; had surgery on a 'minor undisclosed injury' in the spring of 2015 but missed no time in the fall. Ward is a better run defender than pass rusher. His best scheme fit is at DE in a 3-4 front but he's scheme versatile. Ward is an ascending player who is raw but capable of outplaying his mid-round draft slot. -April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Ward is raw, but he has an excellent combination of size, power and quality athleticism that give him a high ceiling. He is a better run defender than pass-rusher at this point. His best scheme fit is at defensive end in a 3-4 front, but he's scheme versatile and has shown the ability to reduce inside where he can become a disruptive pass-rusher with proper development. <br>

Henry is a big, powerful back with improved vision and a punishing run style, but struggles to quickly redirect and is limited as a pass catcher. He was mostly durable (sans broken fibula as early enrollee in '13) despite 620 offensive touches. Day 2 grade. -April 9, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> The former Heisman Trophy winner is a punishing runner with a freakish height, weight and speed combination. Henry has excellent power and balance as a runner and is an absolute nightmare to tackle when he gets to the second level where he shows deceptive top-end speed to outrun pursuit. He is high cut though, which hampers his lateral agility and ability to make defenders miss and he becomes far less effective when defenses are able to create penetration. A lack of versatility in the passing game is a concern, but he has a chance to develop into a No. 1 back who can end up being a workhorse. -- Kevin Weidl

Robinson's raw ability is undeniable, and he appears unblockable at times. But his motor runs hot-and-cold, he plays with marginal leverage and he needs a lot of refinement as a pass rusher. If a team takes Robinson in the first round, it will be placing a large bet on its defensive line coach's ability to maximize Robinson's unique skill set. -April 9, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Robinson is a powerful run-stopper with the potential to develop into a disruptive pass-rusher. There's also a lot to like about his versatility as he's strong, long and athletic enough to play defensive tackle in a base four-man front and defensive end in three-man fronts. Robinson's downside is he doesn't play every snap with the same kind of urgency, and he's an unpolished pass-rusher who isn't an effective hand fighter at this point. -- Steve Muench

The nephew of Keyshawn Johnson, Thomas is an underrated wideout with a long frame and more natural ability than some people think. His average 40-time at the Combine (4.57) overshadowed other impressive results for his size, particularly the broad jump (10'6""), 10-yard split (1.55) and 3-cone (6.80). Thomas, who has a second-round grade, needs route running polish but has the tools to develop into a productive outside starter in the NFL. -March 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> The nephew of Keyshawn Johnson, Thomas didn't run particularly well at the combine (4.57 in the 40-yard dash). He ran a slightly quicker time at his pro day (4.53), however, and that time is a more accurate reflection of his playing speed. In addition, the 40 time overshadowed an otherwise impressive combine performance as he tested well in other key areas. The bottom line is that Thomas has the frame, athletic ability and ball skills to develop into an effective No. 2 wide receiver, but he still needs to improve his route running.

<b> How he fits:</b> The Saints have some depth here with Willie Snead exceeding expectations and Brandon Coleman flashing last year, but they also released Marques Colston. Adding a receiver capable of competing for the starting role opposite the talented Brandin Cooks makes sense, and with that in mind and Thomas fits the mold.

That athleticism flashes on tape too and he moves more than well enough to make up for his slightly below average arm length. However, he's just scratching the surface in terms of his upside and the tape doesn't consistently match up with the talent. His potential might be too tough for a team to pass on earlier but he grades out as a second round pick.

Spriggs has the potential to develop into a franchise left tackle despite his slightly below average arm length.

He won't be a high-impact pass rusher, but he is a better athlete than his production indicates and he is capable (because of his power and surprising closing burst) of collapsing the pocket. Reed has an off-the-field incident (July 2014 DUI), but his work ethic and football character are strong. Reed is a first round talent. --March 12, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Reed is the best run-stopping defensive tackle in this class. He plays with excellent leverage and has the anchor, along with the upper-body power, to eat up space as a two-gapper at the next level. He shows heavy and active hands discarding blocks when tied up in a phone booth. He doesn't have great production as a pass-rusher, but he wasn't asked to rush the passer within his defensive scheme at Alabama. Reed has shown the ability to push the pocket from the interior. He will instantly upgrade the interior of the defensive line. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> The 19th ranked player on our board and the top available player, Reed is an excellent value. He also fills a need as Seattle needed to add depth at defensive tackle with Brandon Mebane signing with San Diego and Jordan Hill battling a toe injury late in the 2015 season. Reed is an outstanding run defender whose toughness and strength make him a good for Seattle's stout front, plus he has some upside as a pass-rusher. -- Steve Muench",5.21,31.0,,104.0,7.77,4.75

He has the ability to add immediate depth on the interior who can provide depth at center and guard early on in his career. He also has the frame, toughness and smarts to develop into a starter in time. There's also a lot to like about his intangibles. He's is a proven leader and the younger brother of Zack Martin, Dallas' 2014 first-round pick. --March 1, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Martin is a steady and versatile interior offensive lineman with experience at both center and guard. He comes with some limitations athletically, but he makes up for it with excellent technique and balance. Martin takes quality angles as a run-blocker and has enough size and inline power to lock on and sustain blocks. He has enough short-area quickness and shows very good awareness in pass pro. The former Notre Dame lineman has a chance to become a quality starter on the interior for the next decade. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> Martin is an experienced, plug-and-play starter that fills the void left by Ben Jones' departure in free agency.  In addition, he brings quality versatility to provide depth at guard if need be. -- Kevin Weidl",5.22,28.0,28.0,97.0,7.57,4.72

His best season was as a freshman under then-head coach Bill O'Brien (Texans). Hackenberg has ideal size, a big-league arm and adequate pocket mobility. In order to succeed in the NFL, his decision making must continue to improve, and he must become more consistent with his footwork in order to elevate his accuracy. -April 9, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Hackenberg is a tough evaluation. On one hand, his size, arm strength and the potential he showed as a freshman make him an intriguing Day 2 prospect. Plus, while you don't want to make excuses, his porous pass protection and average receiver play factored into his subpar production the past two seasons. On the other hand, his underwhelming tape, career completion percentage (56.1 percent) and ball placement are significant concerns. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> The Jets have a pressing need at quarterback considering Ryan Fitzpatrick remains unsigned, Geno Smith isn't the long-term answer and Bryce Petty may never develop into a starter. In addition, offensive coordinator Chan Gailey is capable of unlocking Hackenberg's considerable upside, so Hackenberg could be the long-term answer.

However, Jones isn't as experienced as Thompson, who was a three-year starter, coming out. He didn't crack the starting lineup until 2015. He's also even lighter than Thompson. That said the value Jones, who reportedly ran in the 4.3s potentially brings as a sub-package linebacker and core special teams' contributor should make him. April 10, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> The former LSU linebacker lacks prototypical measurables for the position, but he is an explosive athlete who holds up well in space. He has adequate instincts and an elite closing burst that provides him with sideline-to-sideline range as a run defender. In addition, he brings good value on third downs with the ability to hold up in coverage. Jones is an instinctive and explosive blitzer. He will never be a strong point-of-attack defender, but he has a chance to excel as weakside linebacker in a 4-3 defense. <br>
<b> How he fits:</b> The Falcons needed to upgrade their playmaking ability at linebacker and Jones fits the bill.

He is a bit of tweener who posted below average speed (4.69) and jump numbers at his pro day, and while he shows quality playmaking instincts in coverage, he has limitations with his range in the back end. Cravens does physical mentality to hold up near the box where he lined up for the majority of snaps the past 2 seasons (2014-'15). Similar to Cardinals DS Deone Buchanon (2014) and Panthers OLB Shaq Thompson (2015), Cravens fits in the hybrid mold and should be off the board within the top-70 selections. April 3, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Cravens is a hybrid defender with experience at both safety, outside linebacker and nickel, in the mold of Cardinals linebacker Deon Bucannon. He has very good instincts and overall awareness and is a physical run defender who is effective at getting off blocks and working through clutter as a run defender. Cravens has some limitations in terms of range as the last line of defense in coverage, but he has the ability to matchup with tight ends in man coverage and brings added value as a blitzer. The versatility to line him up in multiple spots will be valued in today's NFL. He should also be a big contributor on special teams. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Cravens is a tweener outside linebacker/safety who will most likely line up at strong safety based on Washington's needs. Washington benched Dashon Goldson after he struggled last season, and the Redskins need a strong safety capable of pushing for the starting job opposite converted corner DeAngelo Hall. If he doesn't line up at safety, he also has the skill set to be an effective situational linebacker who helps improve a Washington pass defense that finished 25th in yards allowed per game in 2015. -- Steve Muench",,,,,,

He is an undersized CB with quality press-man coverage skills and with enough speed to run with receivers down the field. He does come with some minor durability issues including a hamstring injury that limited him in both playoff games. His lack of ball production is concerning as he did not record an INT throughout his career (Zero CBs drafted in the 1st round of the modern draft without an INT). Alexander projects as a top-40 pick who has the potential to develop into a starter. -- April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> The biggest knock on Alexander is he didn't intercept a pass in his two seasons at Clemson and he might never be much of a ball hawk. Alexander's technique and footwork are inconsistent as well. He still projects as a Day 2 pick because he has the balance, fluidity and top-end speed to match up in man when his technique is sound. He has the potential to develop into an effective starter. -- Steve Muench

Boyd is more of possession receiver who is a smooth athlete that has outstanding ball skills and a natural feel for the position. Improved his 40-time from 4.58 (Combine) to 4.50 at pro-day. DUI arrest in June of 2015, but has excellent football character. Boyd holds a mid-day 2 grade with a chance to become a quality #3 WR. -- April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings: </b> Boyd is a versatile receiver with the ability to play on the outside or in the slot. He's not a burner, but he is a smooth athlete who can create separation with detailed route running. He has one of the most reliable sets of hands in this class and shows excellent body control adjusting to throws outside of his frame. Boyd is an instinctive and decisive runner with the ability to manufacture yards both after the catch and as a returner on special teams. He has a chance to develop into a solid complement to a No. 1 or an excellent No. 3 for a receiving corps. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> A.J. Green is one of the best WRs in the league but Marvin Jones and Mohamed Sanu departed via free agency, making receiver one of Cincinnati's pressing needs.

He comes with outstanding make-up (team captain for 2015) and has started in 50 of 51 career games. While he is a technician he has room to improve his lower body power. Whitehair currently projects to come off the board within the first 75 selections. February 28, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Whitehair has lined up at offensive tackle the past three seasons, but he has short arms and projects better at guard, where he started nine games in 2012. He could project at center, too. He is a four-year starter and team captain who is assignment sound in the run game and shows outstanding awareness in pass protection. He is a fundamentally sound positional run-blocker and an above-average pass-blocker with above-average balance. -- Steve Muench

He is gifted athlete that brings a physical presence as a run defender but needs to improve his instincts and recognition skills if he is every going to settle into a starting role. The positive news is that Green is a standout on special teams coverage units where he can buy himself time as he develops early in his career. Green projects as a mid-day three selection in the 2016 NFL draft. -- April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Green is one of the most intriguing safeties in this class due to his athleticism. He displays explosive movement skills with quality fluidity and an exceptional closing burst. However, he lacks ideal instincts in coverage and needs to quicken up his recognition and reaction skills. On the flip side, he is a very effective and physical tackler who also excels on special-teams coverage units. -- Kevin Weidl

He currently projects as a fringe day two selection. --April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Though his best fit appears to be at safety, where he started for two seasons, Davis is a versatile defensive back who moved to corner in 2015. He's a reliable run defender who fights to get off blocks and shows good strength wrapping up ball carriers. He also shows good instincts and range in coverage for a safety, but he'll need to play in a heavy press-man or press-zone scheme to line up at corner in the NFL. -- Steve Muench

He has ideal measurables with quality bulk, long arms and heavy hands that provide him with excellent point-of-attack skills. He is most effective as an interior pass-rusher, where he uses his quickness and power combination to gain initial leverage on blockers. Gotsis is coming off a season-ending knee injury, but assuming he checks out medically, he has the size, athleticism, versatility and physical edge to develop into a starter, ideally as a 5-technique for a base 3-4 scheme. -- Kevin Weidl

He's a playmaker with above-average instincts and the production to prove it; he finished his college career with 19 interceptions. He's also a good tackler and reliable run defender. -- Steve Muench

However, he was playing his best football toward the end of the season where he showed he has the talent to develop into a quality starter on the interior. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> Nick Hayden has yet to record a sack in 47 starts in his three years with the organization and Terrell McClain enters a contract year in 2017, so Dallas needed to infuse competition and depth next to Tyrone Crawford. Collins' initial quickness makes him a good fit for the Cowboys' scheme and he could prove to be a steal if he gets back to playing the way he did on his 2014 tape. -- Steve Muench",5.03,29.5,25.0,109.0,7.53,4.52

He has the instincts and cover skills to fit in either a man or zone coverage scheme. Redmond has the skill set and mental demeanor to contribute on special teams in the NFL. He compares favorably to Cortland Finnegan. Redmond is ahead of schedule with his rehab and is scheduled to have a private workout for scouts in early April and should still come off the board in the day two range. -- March 11, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Redmond has the instincts and cover skills to fit in either a man or zone coverage scheme. In addition, he shows a very good closing burst and does a nice job of locating and playing the ball. He also has the mental demeanor to contribute on special teams at the next level. Redmond has limited experience after only having seven career starts -- all coming last fall -- before his 2015 season was cut short because of a torn ACL in his right knee. Those two factors could impact his draft position. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> The 49ers are looking for stability opposite of Tramaine Brock and help to improve a 27th-ranked pass defense.  Redmond provides quality instincts, good top-end speed and plays with an edge.  He may need time to develop (only seven career starts) and is coming off of a torn ACL this past season.  -- Kevin Weidl",4.45,,,,,

He compiled 33 career tackles for loss and 21.5 sacks (including a single-season school record of 13.5 in 2015). Short-shuttle (4.50) and 3-cone (7.35) are near or below red flag level for the position. Ngakoue is one of the more natural edge rushers in this class. But he needs to improve his instincts and get stronger if he wants to become a three-down edge defender. Ngakoue currently projects as an early-to-mid Day 3 developmental prospect. --April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Ngakoue is a developmental prospect who needs to improve his diagnostic skills and get stronger at the point of attack if he wants to develop into an every-down player. While he moves well on tape, his short shuttle (4.50) and three-cone (7.35) times are red flags for outside linebackers. That said, he's one of the most natural pass-rushers in this class, and he hasn't reached his potential yet. The former Terrapin has the bend, burst and quick hands to make an immediate impact as a situational pass-rusher. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> The Jaguars get Dante Fowler back from a knee injury, signed Malik Jackson and Jared Odrick returns. However, Ngakoue is at his best getting after the quarterback and adding another edge rusher makes sense considering they need another edge rusher (neither Jackson nor Odrick has recorded more than six sacks in a season). Still, he's a bit of  reach and there are better options still on the board. -- Steve Muench",4.75,34.5,26.0,118.0,7.35,4.5

He has the frame to develop into a starting defensive end regardless of the front and possibly outside linebacker in a base three-man front. He needs to improve his leverage as a run defender and continue to develop as a hand fighter rushing the passer. He's also on the older size as he will be a 25-year old rookie but he's a fringe Day 2 value all things considered. April 10, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> A coach's son and team captain, Kaufusi is an above-average athlete for his size -- he even played basketball on the 2012-13 BYU basketball team. He's a versatile player with the ability to line up at left defensive end, 3-4 defensive end or possibly 3-4 outside linebacker. Kaufusi has the frame to develop into an effective interior pass-rusher. He is not, however, an explosive edge rusher and inconsistent pad level is an issue when it comes to defending the run. -- Steve Muench 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> Kaufusi fits the Baltimore's profile with size and versatility. He has excellent length to set the edge which will go a long way in replacing Courtney Upshaw (left via free agency).

He is a ball hawking safety whose 19 career INTs broke the MWC record previously held by Eric Weddle. While Thompson has average athleticism (improved 40 from 4.69 at combine to 4.60 at pro day) he is an instinctive and steady player who understands leverage and the geometry of the game with his angles. Thompson will add immediate depth and has the potential to quickly develop into a starter. He projects a top-100 selection. April 3, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Thompson finished his college career with 19 interceptions and broke the Mountain West record for career interceptions previously held by Baltimore safety Eric Weddle. He's an instinctive player who makes sound reads and understands opponents' tendencies. He's consistently in good position as a result and he has the ball skills to take advantage when quarterbacks try to test him. He's also an effective run-stopper who wraps and finishes when he's able to square up. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> This pick makes sense from both value and need standpoints, as the Giants need a safety capable of competing for the starting job opposite Landon Collins. A four-year starter at Boise State, Thompson has the instincts to push for a starting role early in his career and he's a playmaker on the back end. -- Steve Muench  ",4.69,32.5,12.0,118.0,7.26,4.33

He played 49 games (35 starts) in four seasons at Florida and racked up 178 total tackles, 33.5 TFL and 12 sacks. Despite multiple nagging injuries during the second half of 2015, Bullard had his best season as a senior (66 tackles, 17.5 TFL and 6.5 sacks). He might not be a first round pick like former Gator defensive linemen Sharrif Floyd (Vikings, '13), Dominique Easley (Patriots, '14), and Dante Fowler (Jaguars, '15) but Bullard should hear his name called on Day 2. -April 9, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Bullard is a versatile defensive lineman who plays with a physical edge and relentless motor. He started his career at defensive end before bumping inside as a senior where he was much more productive. Bullard isn't an elite athlete but he has excellent first-step quickness to create disruption in the backfield as a one-gap run defender. He possesses heavy hands but needs to continue to refine his hand-usage in combat, particularly as a pass-rusher. He could develop into a quality starter, ideally as a 3-technique for a base 4-3 defense. He also has the size and core strength to hold up as a five-technique for an odd front. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> Bullard brings great versatility within defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's hybrid front.  Chicago continues to get stronger up front with Bullard, who has excellent first-step quickness and brings a tone-setting mentality to the front seven. -- Kevin Weidl ",4.93,32.0,23.0,116.0,7.31,4.56

He has home-run ability as a runner, receiver and return specialist (averaged 26.6 yards per KOR in 2015, including his 95-yard TD in the CFP championship). But there are enough concerns regarding durability (missed all but five games in 2014 due to a broken leg and missed two games in 2015 with a fractured right arm), ball security and strength (as a runner and blocker) to keep him out of the first few rounds. --February 18, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Drake is a versatile back who could contribute in multiple facets. He lacks ideal power and is not an exceptional between-the-tackles runner. Drake, however, has good vision and a nice combination of lateral quickness and speed to make defenders miss and create yards on his own. The former Crimson Tide star also brings quality value in the passing game and on special teams as a returner. He comes with some durability issues and ball security concerns, but he will have a chance to find a home at the next level as a change-of-pace runner. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Dolphins were unable to re-sign tailback Lamar Miller, and Jay Ajayi has a history of knee injuries. Drake doesn't project as a bell-cow back, but he has the talent to help ease the load for Ajayi and make substantial contributions as a rookie, if he can stay healthy. Drake is also versatile enough to help out on third down and in the return game. -- Steve Muench ",4.45,34.5,10.0,123.0,7.04,4.21

In 2015, he suffered a broke tibia in his right leg against Boston College and missed the season finale vs Stanford and the Fiesta Bowl vs Ohio St. Didn't workout at the combine but tested well at his pro day. He is an instinctive and athletic CB that showed better ball skills in 2015. Had a highly contested battle with USC WR JuJu Smith. Russell projects as a fringe day 2 pick. April 3, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Russell is a well-rounded player with quality movement skill and natural instincts. He shows quick recognition skills that enable him to get an early break on the ball, and he also has above-average mirror skills. Russell shows good ball awareness when tracking and playing the ball in the air. He is a willing and reliable tackler. There are concerns about his availability; he has not put together a full season since 2013 due to injuries and suspensions. He has a chance to develop into a quality starter. <br>
<b> How he fits:</b>Longtime stalwart CB Sean Smith is now a Raider, while 2014 third-round pick Phillip Gaines is coming off of a torn ACL.  Russell is an instinctive, fluid and physical cornerback that has excellent ball awareness to fit within Kansas City's press-man scheme and adds depth opposite of rookie Pro-Bowler Marcus Peters. -- Kevin Weidl",4.49,,17.0,,,

He is a long, crafty and a highly productive pass rusher who had double digit sacks in each season as a starter including 10.5 in 2015 (38 total). While Calhoun is adept at rushing the pass he most become more consistent vs the run and there are also concerns about his up and down play. Skipped SR bowl while dealing with a minor unknown injury. Calhoun worthy of a top-100 pick who has the tools to become an impact edge rusher if developed properly. April 2, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> A two-time captain, Calhoun is at his best rushing the passer and he wins in different ways. He's an active hand fighter who makes it tough to lock on and flashes the ability to counter when he does get reached. He dips his inside shoulder, gets under blockers and cuts down the angle to the quarterback. He mixes it up with quick inside moves. However, he weighs just 250 pounds and he needs to get stronger against the run. His best position fit is left defensive end based on the tape, but he could move to 3-4 outside linebacker. -- Steve Muench
<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Justin Tuck retired and Mario Edwards sustained a neck injury last season, so Calhoun could see immediate time. In addition, Aldon Smith began serving a one-year suspension last November, so adding an edge rusher was a priority, and Calhoun is a good value at this point.  -- Steve Muench",4.82,35.0,23.0,115.0,6.97,4.25

He finished his college career with 21 PBUs and 10 interceptions in three seasons, including six in 2015. Teams will need to investigate an altercation with a female in September 2014, after which he pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor assault charge and was suspended for two games. Improved 40 time from a 4.64 at combine to 4.56 at pro day. Worley has projects as a fringe day two prospect who has the potential to develop into a quality starting CB for a press man or zone scheme. April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Worley is a big and physical press cornerback who has above-average fluidity for his size. He shows better speed on tape than timed speed indicates and has very good range to hold up on an island outside the hashes. In addition, he shows quality awareness playing the ball and brings a physical edge as a run defender. Worley comes with some character concerns, but he has a very high ceiling and the potential to develop into an impact starter. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Panthers general manager Dave Gettleman has taken two corners with consecutive picks, and that shouldn't come as surprise as corner was considered a need even before the team severed ties with Josh Norman. Worley is a physical player who shows good instincts in zone, making him a good fit for the Panthers' scheme. -- Steve Muench",4.64,35.5,14.0,123.0,6.98,4.15

His 2015 tape is a little erratic but he played out of positon at left tackle. He's a better fit on the inside where his short arms aren't as much of a concern. Plus he excelled in the tests that correlate best with interior offensive linemen transitioning to the NFL. His 40-time, short shuttle and broad jump were all outstanding at the Combine. He projects as a versatile backup interior offensive lineman with the potential to develop into a starter. March 19, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> A three-year starter, Thuney played every position along the offensive line while at NC State. His 2015 tape is a little up and down, but he was playing out of position at left tackle. He's a much better fit on the inside, where he has the quick feet to develop into an effective zone blocker and stay in front of his assignment in pass protection. He projects as a versatile reserve early in his career, but he has the potential to develop into a starter down the road. -- Steve Muench

<b> How he fits:</b> Thuney has experience lining up at all five positions on the offensive line and should provide immediate depth as a versatile reserve lineman for the Patriots, who have been hit by the injury in recent years. -- Kevin Weidl",,,,,,

There is some concern about his long-term durability considering he missed the 2014 season with a foot injury. His length also raises concern about his ability to protect the edge, but he has the frame, toughness and smarts to provide quality depth along the interior offensive line early in his career and develop into a starter down the road. --March 7, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Seumalo is a versatile offensive lineman who has experience playing multiple positions at Oregon State. He lacks ideal length and has marginal strength, so he projects to line up as a center at the next level. He possesses adequate first-step quickness and takes quality initial angles as a run-blocker. However, Seumalo has to learn to play with more balance, both as a run-blocker and in pass protection. The former Beaver shows quality awareness and plays with an aggressive edge and has the potential to add immediate depth. -- Kevin Weidl

He built on that momentum in 2015 and finished with a two-season total (2014-15) of 97 tackles, 17.5 TFLs and 8.5 sacks in 27 games. Washington's career came to an abrupt halt in December thanks to a solicitation charge that resulted in his Fiesta Bowl suspension. He was dominant at the Senior Bowl, but performed surprisingly poorly at the combine. Washington may slip a bit on Day 2 of the draft, but he's skilled enough to develop into an every-down NFL starting DT. --March 29, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Washington is a one-gap penetrator who is best fit as a 3-technique for a base 4-3 front. He doesn't have point-of-attack skills as a run defender, and he becomes far less effective when he plays with high pad level. Washington, however, has the first-step quickness and active hands to squeeze through gaps and create disruption, both as run defender and as a pass-rusher on the interior. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> DT Kyle Williams is 32 years old and missed 10 games with a knee injury last year, so Buffalo needed to add depth on the interior defensive line.

In two seasons at Stanford, Hooper hauled in 74 catches for 934 yards (12.7) with eight touchdowns. He needs to continue to get stronger as blocker but he has a quality feel awareness and angles in this area. Hooper grades out as a Day 2 prospect and he has the raw tools to eventually outplay his draft slot. He should be the next Stanford tight end to produce in the NFL (Zach Ertz, Coby Fleener, Levine Tiololo and Jim Dray). -April 11, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Hooper has good size potential and the talent to develop into a pass-catching weapon. He has the athleticism to create separation with enough speed to threaten the intermediate to deep middle part of the field. In addition, he has above-average hands and body control adjusting to throws outside of his frame. He needs to continue to add weight and add strength, both as a run-blocker and as a route runner. -- Kevin Weidl

He's also big and strong enough to provide depth at offensive guard (where he started in 2012) and/or right tackle making him an intriguing swingman candidate early in his career. But he is a developmental prospect who needs to refine his technique to maximize that awesome potential and succeed working against the level of competition he'll face in the NFL. At this point, he projects as a late Day 2 pick. -- April 10, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Clark is a four-year starter who needs to continue to work on technique, but he has exceptional measurables. He needs to show more patience in his pass sets, but he possesses very good range with quick feet and long arms to handle speed rushers off the edge. Clark displays quality inline power as a run-blocker but has to learn to play with better pad level to maximize his potential in this area. He has a very high ceiling if developed properly, and his ability to be a swing tackle only increases his value.

Jenkins dealt with a hip flexor injury in the middle of the season (DNP vs Mizzou) and only recorded 4 sacks (3 sacks in first 2 games vs LA Monroe and Vanderbilt and 1 the remaining 10 he played in). While he's not an elite athlete, Jenkins plays a physical and heavy game to set the edge vs the run and provide some pass rush ability as an edge defender (Best Fit -34 OLB). Jenkins projects as a top-100 selection. April 7, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Jenkins is a better football player than athlete whose game is predicated on physicality and toughness.

Fuller doesn't have elite fluidity or top-end speed, but makes up for it with quality FBI's, technique, ball skills and is physical vs the run. 3 older brothers (DS Vincent - WR Corey - CB Kyle) all played at VT and are playing or played in the NFL. Fuller is better football player than athlete who projects as a starting press-CB or potential FS. April 2, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Fuller underwent wrist surgery last offseason and sat out most of the 2015 season because of a knee injury, so there are concerns about his ability to stay healthy. He's not a quick-twitch athlete with smooth change of direction skills on tape, either. He has the instincts, frame and toughness, however, to mask his athletic deficiencies in coverage, and he has the ball skills to develop into a playmaker. -- Steve Muench

Naturally, he's a raw route runner and will need time to adjust to a more complex NFL passing game. But Miller is dynamic playmaker, and his improvement in just one season at WR is promising. The juice might be worth the squeeze with Miller as a Day 2 pick. -March 5, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Miller, who started his career at quarterback before switching to receiver for his final season, is one of the most explosive and natural athletes in this class.

He must continue to add strength to become more consistent at the point attack and will need to prove he can be more of a difference maker in coverage on third downs (Career: 2 PBUs, 1 INT). Vigil holds a mid-to-late day 3 grade who has the potential to add depth and be a quality contributor on special teams. March 23, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Vigil is an instinctive linebacker with a nose for the ball. He has one of the better finesse games for a linebacker in terms of locating the ball, sorting through trash and taking quality angles to runners. He needs to continue to add bulk and strength to become more consistent at the point of attack. While Vigil has adequate range in coverage, he doesn't have great playmaking ability or production. He has enough tools to develop into a starter if he's able to improve his strength, but the good news is that he can contribute on special teams while he develops. -- Kevin Weidl

He possesses quality core strength and uses length well to set the edge as a run defender. The former Aggie flashes upside as a pass-rusher with good initial quickness, length and the ability to bend the edge. He also holds up well in coverage. Fackrell comes with durability concerns and needs to play with more of a physical edge at times. He should add immediate depth with the potential to quickly develop into a starter.<br>

He was the best player at the EW Shrine game and his Combine results were outstanding (including 1.69 10-split and 34-inch VJ). He's a raw but quick and powerful player with the tools to develop into a good NFL starter. He takes to hard coaching and has no off-the-field issues. He grades out as a Day 2 prospect. -March 22, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Hargrave is a four-year starter who dominated the FCS level, stood out as the best player at the East-West Shrine Game and tested well at the scouting combine, where he posted a 1.69 10-yard split and a 34½-inch vertical jump and measurements of 6-foot-1 and 309 pounds. He doesn't have great length and he needs to improve his ability to get off blocks, but he has the upper-body strength to get better in that area.

His ability to progress - most notably with his decision making as a ball carrier and technique in pass pro - will have a big impact on his draft stock with that in mind. However, he's a better fit at running back and should benefit from the move in the long run. It's also important to note that he has the potential to be a core special teams' player so he doesn't have to make an immediate impact as a runner. September 27, 2015 <b>What he brings:</b> This former wide receiver takes too long to locate seams and hesitates too much when running between the tackles. In addition, he drops passes he should catch despite his experience at receiver. He's still one of the most intriguing running backs prospects in this class, however. At 6-foot, 220 pounds, he has quick feet for his size. Though he doesn't play quite as fast on tape, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.48 seconds at the combine so he has upside. -- Steve Muench

State in 2014 and completed 60-percent of his throws with a 4.7-to-1 TD-INT ratio during his two seasons at the helm (15-11 as starter). Brissett has the tools and work ethic to develop into a very good backup QB in the NFL (with an outside chance of emerging as an adequate starter), which we believe is worthy of a Day 2 grade. --February 11, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Brissett, who transferred from Florida to NC State, started the past two seasons for the Wolfpack and completed 60 percent of his passes as a senior. There's a lot to like about his frame and pocket mobility. He also has more than enough arm strength to succeed at the NFL level. However, there's room for improvement when it comes to ball placement as he misses within the strike and forces receivers to adjust too much. He has the potential to develop into a valuable backup and effective spot starter. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> The courts have reinstated the league's four-game suspension of Tom Brady, and Jimmy Garoppolo is the only other quarterback on the roster, so quarterback is a need for New England.

But he is very accurate on short-to-intermediate throws, has outstanding football intelligence, and extends a lot of plays with his awareness and sneaky quickness. In a precision-based system, Kessler can be a good backup in the NFL, which is why we give him a Day 3 grade. -April 10, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Kessler was a three-year starter with a 27-16 career record for the Trojans. He lacks ideal measurables and has physical limitations, including a lack of ideal arm strength to stretch the field vertically. On the flip side, he is a cerebral signal-caller with experience running a pro-style progression read system, and he has very good poise and awareness in the pocket. Kessler also shows adequate touch and accuracy in the short-to-intermediate part of the field. He has a chance to develop into a functional backup for a team that implements heavy West Coast principles predicated on getting the ball out quickly with rhythm and timing. -- Kevin Weidl

He is just a one year starter and had marginal production in 2015 -- 19 catches for 169 yards and 0 TDS -- due to scheme and the amount of talent he was surrounded by on the Buckeyes offense. However, Vannett took advantage of the SR bowl where he had a strong performance showcasing his route running and ball skills. Vannett should have more impact at the pro level than in college and is worthy of a top-75 selection. April 3, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Vannett has prototypical measurables along with above-average athleticism as a two-way Y-tight end. He was not heavily targeted in the Buckeyes' offense due to scheme and the abnormal amount of talent on the offense. He has quality agility for his size and has the ability to create separation in the intermediate-to-underneath part of the field. Vannett also shows the toughness to do the dirty work the position requires, and he is an improved blocker with an above-average inline power base. He has a chance to develop into a quality starting tight end who should be more productive in the NFL. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> New England has 2015 first-round pick Malcolm Brown and Alan Branch, plus it signed Terrance Knighton and Markus Kuhn, but the Patriots were expected to address defensive tackle.

That's if he's able to transition from left tackle and that's not the biggest concern when it comes to his evaluation. He's missed at least four games in each of his final three seasons in college so how he checks out medically will have a big impact on if and where he gets drafted.

March 15, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> A team captain and four-year starter, Ehinger lined up at right guard, left tackle and right tackle during his college career. While he played left tackle in 2015 and may be able to fill in at right tackle in a pinch, his best fit is at guard where his arm length isn't as much of a concern.

There's also a lot to like about his confidence, short-term memory and professional approach to the game (Team captain in 2015). On the flip side, his lacks of ball production raises some concerns and he may have a tough time adjusting to the NFL game due to his physical style of play in coverage. Murray should be off the board with the top-100 picks. April 2, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Murray is a physical press corner with enough length and upper body strength to reroute receivers. He tested well at the scouting combine, and he's fast enough to run with most receivers. In addition, he rarely gets caught out of position and he gets an early break on the ball with some regularity. However, he doesn't have great size for a press corner and his physical style of play is more prone to draw flags at the NFL level.

However, he's still one of the more underrated receiver prospects in this class because he plays faster than his timed top-end speed (4.53) and averaged better than 22 yards per catch in his final two seasons.

Smith could bring strong return as an early-to-mid day 3 developmental pick that could develop into a quality sub-package reserve. March 14, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> A four-year starter, Smith is a fluid corner with the quickness and balance to mirror in man coverage. He shows above-average instincts and a good feel for route concepts as well. The downside is he's undersized. He doesn't match up well with bigger receivers and he graded out as a below-average run-stopper.

He runs well and shows good pop out of breaks to create separation. He also shows a good feel for soft spots working against zone coverage.

Mitchell has a chance to become a quality number 3 at the next level and projects as an early day three selection for the 2016 draft. January 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Mitchell is a polished route runner with the ability to work outside the hashes and in the slot. He is not an imposing receiver from a physical standpoint, but he has a nice feel as a route runner in terms of setting up defenders to create separation. He has the speed to stretch the field vertically. Mitchell comes with one of the more reliable sets of hands in this class. He has some minor durability issues, but he could develop into a versatile No. 3 receiver if he's able to stay healthy. <br>

Louis has plenty of upside due his size, strength and speed combination (4.43 - 40, 38-inch VJ, 11-foot BJ). He showed well at the during the week of the NFLPA. Louis projects as a mid-day three developmental selection. -- April 8, 2016 <b>What he brings:</b> Louis is a raw route runner with smaller hands, and he drops passes he should catch. Auburn's scheme likely stunted his growth as a route runner though. But, his upside is intriguing as Louis has good size and long arms -- he tested well at the NFL scouting combine. His 4.43 40-time, 38-inch vertical and 11-foot broad jump are notable results for a receiver prospect.

He's a shifty runner who makes it tough for defenders to get a clean hit on him, and he shows good burst around the edge. While he doesn't play quite as fast as his timed top-end speed (4.41), he's more than fast enough to make defenses pay for giving him a crease.

His instincts and recognition skills are elite, which allows him to play much faster than his below-average timed speed (4.81 40-yard dash and 4.51 short shuttle at the NFL Combine).

Murray was the No. 9 overall pick by the Oakland Athletics in the 2018 MLB draft. If selected in the first round of the NFL draft, Murray would become the first athlete to be selected in the first round of both drafts. He is an aggressive playmaker but also displays good overall decision-making skills and shows poise under pressure. Murray has fast eyes when making full-field progression reads. He displays natural touch and timing as a passer, throwing accurately from a variety of different arm angles. He really excels at off-balance throws but he gets into trouble when he falls off of throws, typically when the pocket is collapsing. He has a quick trigger and a strong arm. There is an elite combination of quickness and speed, and he is arguably the most explosive QB prospect since Michael Vick. He does an excellent job of sensing defenders and protecting his undersized frame by sliding. His eyes drop when scrambling at times, which leads to him missing some open targets. In the right system, Kyler can be a good NFL starter and an electrifying playmaker at the quarterback position. But there are unique risks if using a first-round pick on Murray, including his lean frame, his lack of experience and his option to bail on football in pursuit of a promising baseball career at any moment. -- March 19, 2019 Murray is an aggressive playmaker with a strong arm, quick release and elite quickness, yet he is also a sound decision-maker who stays poised under pressure and isn't easily rattled by mistakes. He throws the ball accurately from a variety of arm angles and excels at making off-balance throws. Arizona hired Kliff Kingsbury to fix the NFL's worst offense, and he has a reputation for developing young quarterbacks, most notably Patrick Mahomes at Texas Tech. While there's an argument for sticking with last year's first-round pick (Josh Rosen) with that in mind, giving Kingsbury the player who best fits his system makes more sense -- and Kingsbury has long been enamored with Murray's skill set. Kingsbury will adapt his offense to his quarterback, so the more dynamic the QB, the more dynamic the offense -- and Murray is the most dynamic QB in this class. Still, the offensive line needs to play better than it did last season for Murray to realize his considerable potential. <i>-- Steve Muench</i>",,,,,,

Bosa is very active versus the run -- he is quick into the blockers' pads, locks out, locates and then disengages in a flash. The former Buckeye has a great motor and just outstanding natural football instincts, knowing where the ball is at all times. He is an elite talent, projecting best as a 4-3 DE, but he's scheme versatile.

San Francisco tied for 22nd in the NFL with 37 sacks last season, and the defense allowed 35 passing touchdowns compared to two interceptions -- the worst ratio in a season in NFL history. Solomon Thomas (2017 first-round pick) is reportedly on the trading block after failing to live up to expectations the past two seasons.

He grades out as an immediate NFL starter and should quickly develop into an interior menace. He's a likely top-5 pick in the 2019 NFL draft. Williams is a well-built defensive tackle with the first-step quickness and strength to advance as a pass-rusher while engaged with an offensive lineman. He rarely loses one-on-one and shows the ability to anchor against double-teams in the running game. He played his best against the best competition in Alabama's biggest games. Taking the best available player and pairing him with a respected defensive coordinator like Gregg Williams is a good way to address a defense in need of an overhaul. Gregg Williams is reportedly staying with the 3-4 base defense, so Quinnen Williams likely will take over as the starter at nose tackle.

He's a solid run defender who sets a hard edge and flashes the ability to make plays in the backfield. Clemson drops him into coverage enough to get a good feel for his ability to move in space and he moves well enough to transition to 3-4 OLB in the NFL. Ferrell plays a lot of snaps and displays a good motor. He's an edge-rusher with very good -- but not elite -- physical tools. He grades out as an every-down NFL starter who's scheme versatile (4-3 DE and/or 3-4 OLB). -- Feb. 26, 2019 Ferrell is an efficient and effective hand fighter.

He sets a hard edge and flashes the ability to disrupt plays in the backfield as a run-defender. He's versatile enough to play defensive end and/or 3-4 outside linebacker. Addressing the defensive end position and the pass rush makes sense considering the Raiders were dead last with 13 sacks last season -- 17 fewer than any other team. In fact, six individual players had more sacks than the Raiders as a team in 2018. The argument also can be made that Ferrell is a better fit for the Raiders' scheme than Kentucky's Josh Allen.

He's not overly physical in terms of using his body and boxing-out defenders. Helm catches most balls thrown within his frame but struggles to adjust at times and has a smaller catch radius. The biggest concern is that he loses focus when he knows he's about to get hit. He's not strong in traffic or on contested throws. He gives effort as a blocker and takes good angles. Helm works to finish but struggles to drive defenders off the point. He's very effective as a move blocker but will struggle to hold up physically as an inline blocker in the NFL. Helm is a late-round or priority free-agent prospect who could make an NFL roster because of his ability to block in space and contribute on special teams. He lacks ideal toughness as a pass-catcher in traffic and has little upside as a difference-maker in the passing game. -- March 6, 2019",4.89,,14.0,,,

As a pass-catcher, Taylor's production improved last season (26 catches after only 16 his first two seasons). He's an adequate route runner but is at his best on shorter routes, struggling to adjust down the field. His biggest weakness is in pass protection; he needs to be more consistently aggressive and fight harder to sustain. Ball security has also been an issue.

He is an undersized quarterback with above-average arm strength and mobility. His short to intermediate accuracy is above average. He rarely misses when his footwork is sound. He falls off some throws and misses on occasion. His downfield touch is erratic. He drops the ball down the back chute but still has a quick delivery, and the ball jumps off his hand. He's tough and more than willing to take a hit to make a play, but we would like to see him hang in the pocket longer and not let oncoming pass-rushers affect his delivery/follow-through as much. He extends plays and has above-average accuracy throwing on the run. He's a threat to scramble for first downs. Patterson grades out as an NFL backup with some intriguing tools.
